   59: 
   60: I.
   61: 
   62: To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
   63: him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
   64: and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
   65: any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that
   66: one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but
   67: admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
   68: reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a
   69: lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never
   70: spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They
   71: were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the
   72: veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
   73: to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
   74: adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
   75: might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
   76: sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power
   77: lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
   78: nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and
   79: that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable
   80: memory.
   81: 
   82: I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us
   83: away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the
   84: home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
   85: finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to
   86: absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of
   87: society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in
   88: Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from
   89: week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the
   90: drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still,
   91: as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his
   92: immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in
   93: following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which
   94: had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time
   95: to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons
   96: to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
   97: of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,
   98: and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so
   99: delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.
  100: Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely
  101: shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of
  102: my former friend and companion.
  103: 
  104: One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was
  105: returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
  106: civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I
  107: passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated
  108: in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the
  109: Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes
  110: again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
  111: His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw
  112: his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against
  113: the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
  114: sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
  115: knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their
  116: own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his
  117: drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
  118: problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which
  119: had formerly been in part my own.
  120: 
  121: His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I
  122: think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly
  123: eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,
  124: and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he
  125: stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular
  126: introspective fashion.
  127: 
  128: "Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have
  129: put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."
  130: 
  131: "Seven!" I answered.
  132: 
  133: "Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more,
  134: I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not
  135: tell me that you intended to go into harness."
  136: 
  137: "Then, how do you know?"
  138: 
  139: "I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
  140: yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and
  141: careless servant girl?"
  142: 
  143: "My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly
  144: have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true
  145: that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful
  146: mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you
  147: deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has
  148: given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it
  149: out."
  150: 
  151: He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands
  152: together.
  153: 
  154: "It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the
  155: inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it,
  156: the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they
  157: have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round
  158: the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
  159: Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile
  160: weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting
  161: specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a
  162: gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black
  163: mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge
  164: on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
  165: his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce
  166: him to be an active member of the medical profession."
  167: 
  168: I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
  169: process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I
  170: remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously
  171: simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each
  172: successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you
  173: explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good
  174: as yours."
  175: 
  176: "Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing
  177: himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe.
  178: The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen
  179: the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."
  180: 
  181: "Frequently."
  182: 
  183: "How often?"
  184: 
  185: "Well, some hundreds of times."
  186: 
  187: "Then how many are there?"
  188: 
  189: "How many? I don't know."
  190: 
  191: "Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is
  192: just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,
  193: because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are
  194: interested in these little problems, and since you are good
  195: enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you
  196: may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick,
  197: pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.
  198: "It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."
  199: 
  200: The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
  201: 
  202: "There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight
  203: o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a
  204: matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of
  205: the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may
  206: safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which
  207: can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all
  208: quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do
  209: not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."
  210: 
  211: "This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that
  212: it means?"
  213: 
  214: "I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before
  215: one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit
  216: theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.
  217: What do you deduce from it?"
  218: 
  219: I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
  220: written.
  221: 
  222: "The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked,
  223: endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper
  224: could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly
  225: strong and stiff."
  226: 
  227: "Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an
  228: English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."
  229: 
  230: I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a
  231: large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.
  232: 
  233: "What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.
  234: 
  235: "The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."
  236: 
  237: "Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for
  238: 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a
  239: customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for
  240: 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental
  241: Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.
  242: "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking
  243: country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being
  244: the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous
  245: glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you
  246: make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue
  247: triumphant cloud from his cigarette.
  248: 
  249: "The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.
  250: 
  251: "Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you
  252: note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of
  253: you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian
  254: could not have written that. It is the German who is so
  255: uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover
  256: what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and
  257: prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if
  258: I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."
  259: 
  260: As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and
  261: grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the
  262: bell. Holmes whistled.
  263: 
  264: "A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing
  265: out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of
  266: beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in
  267: this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."
  268: 
  269: "I think that I had better go, Holmes."
  270: 
  271: "Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my
  272: Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity
  273: to miss it."
  274: 
  275: "But your client--"
  276: 
  277: "Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he
  278: comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best
  279: attention."
  280: 
  281: A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and
  282: in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there
  283: was a loud and authoritative tap.
  284: 
  285: "Come in!" said Holmes.
  286: 
  287: A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six
  288: inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His
  289: dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked
  290: upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed
  291: across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while
  292: the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined
  293: with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch
  294: which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended
  295: halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with
  296: rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence
  297: which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a
  298: broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
  299: part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black
  300: vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,
  301: for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower
  302: part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,
  303: with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive
  304: of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.
  305: 
  306: "You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a
  307: strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He
  308: looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to
  309: address.
  310: 
  311: "Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and
  312: colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me
  313: in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"
  314: 
  315: "You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.
  316: I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
  317: and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most
  318: extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate
  319: with you alone."
  320: 
  321: I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me
  322: back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say
  323: before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."
  324: 
  325: The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said
  326: he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at
  327: the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At
  328: present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it
  329: may have an influence upon European history."
  330: 
  331: "I promise," said Holmes.
  332: 
  333: "And I."
  334: 
  335: "You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The
  336: august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to
  337: you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have
  338: just called myself is not exactly my own."
  339: 
  340: "I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.
  341: 
  342: "The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution
  343: has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense
  344: scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of
  345: Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House
  346: of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."
  347: 
  348: "I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself
  349: down in his armchair and closing his eyes.
  350: 
  351: Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
  352: lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him
  353: as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.
  354: Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his
  355: gigantic client.
  356: 
  357: "If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he
  358: remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."
  359: 
  360: The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
  361: uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he
  362: tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You
  363: are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to
  364: conceal it?"
  365: 
  366: "Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken
  367: before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich
  368: Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and
  369: hereditary King of Bohemia."
  370: 
  371: "But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down
  372: once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you
  373: can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in
  374: my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not
  375: confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I
  376: have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting
  377: you."
  378: 
  379: "Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
  380: 
  381: "The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a
  382: lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known
  383: adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."
  384: 
  385: "Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without
  386: opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of
  387: docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it
  388: was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not
  389: at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography
  390: sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a
  391: staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea
  392: fishes.
  393: 
  394: "Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year
  395: 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera
  396: of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in
  397: London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled
  398: with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and
  399: is now desirous of getting those letters back."
  400: 
  401: "Precisely so. But how--"
  402: 
  403: "Was there a secret marriage?"
  404: 
  405: "None."
  406: 
  407: "No legal papers or certificates?"
  408: 
  409: "None."
  410: 
  411: "Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should
  412: produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is
  413: she to prove their authenticity?"
  414: 
  415: "There is the writing."
  416: 
  417: "Pooh, pooh! Forgery."
  418: 
  419: "My private note-paper."
  420: 
  421: "Stolen."
  422: 
  423: "My own seal."
  424: 
  425: "Imitated."
  426: 
  427: "My photograph."
  428: 
  429: "Bought."
  430: 
  431: "We were both in the photograph."
  432: 
  433: "Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an
  434: indiscretion."
  435: 
  436: "I was mad--insane."
  437: 
  438: "You have compromised yourself seriously."
  439: 
  440: "I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."
  441: 
  442: "It must be recovered."
  443: 
  444: "We have tried and failed."
  445: 
  446: "Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."
  447: 
  448: "She will not sell."
  449: 
  450: "Stolen, then."
  451: 
  452: "Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked
  453: her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice
  454: she has been waylaid. There has been no result."
  455: 
  456: "No sign of it?"
  457: 
  458: "Absolutely none."
  459: 
  460: Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.
  461: 
  462: "But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.
  463: 
  464: "Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the
  465: photograph?"
  466: 
  467: "To ruin me."
  468: 
  469: "But how?"
  470: 
  471: "I am about to be married."
  472: 
  473: "So I have heard."
  474: 
  475: "To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the
  476: King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her
  477: family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a
  478: doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."
  479: 
  480: "And Irene Adler?"
  481: 
  482: "Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I
  483: know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul
  484: of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and
  485: the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry
  486: another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not
  487: go--none."
  488: 
  489: "You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"
  490: 
  491: "I am sure."
  492: 
  493: "And why?"
  494: 
  495: "Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
  496: betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."
  497: 
  498: "Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That
  499: is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to
  500: look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in
  501: London for the present?"
  502: 
  503: "Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the
  504: Count Von Kramm."
  505: 
  506: "Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."
  507: 
  508: "Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."
  509: 
  510: "Then, as to money?"
  511: 
  512: "You have carte blanche."
  513: 
  514: "Absolutely?"
  515: 
  516: "I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
  517: to have that photograph."
  518: 
  519: "And for present expenses?"
  520: 
  521: The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
  522: and laid it on the table.
  523: 
  524: "There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in
  525: notes," he said.
  526: 
  527: Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and
  528: handed it to him.
  529: 
  530: "And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.
  531: 
  532: "Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."
  533: 
  534: Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the
  535: photograph a cabinet?"
  536: 
  537: "It was."
  538: 
  539: "Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon
  540: have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added,
  541: as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If
  542: you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three
  543: o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."
  544: 
  545: 
  546: II.
  547: 
  548: At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had
  549: not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the
  550: house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down
  551: beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,
  552: however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his
  553: inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and
  554: strange features which were associated with the two crimes which
  555: I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the
  556: exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.
  557: Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my
  558: friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of
  559: a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a
  560: pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
  561: quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most
  562: inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable
  563: success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to
  564: enter into my head.
  565: 
  566: It was close upon four before the door opened, and a
  567: drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an
  568: inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.
  569: Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of
  570: disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it
  571: was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he
  572: emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.
  573: Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in
  574: front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
  575: 
  576: "Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again
  577: until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the
  578: chair.
  579: 
  580: "What is it?"
  581: 
  582: "It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I
  583: employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."
  584: 
  585: "I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the
  586: habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."
  587: 
  588: "Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,
  589: however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this
  590: morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a
  591: wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of
  592: them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found
  593: Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but
  594: built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock
  595: to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well
  596: furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those
  597: preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.
  598: Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window
  599: could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round
  600: it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without
  601: noting anything else of interest.
  602: 
  603: "I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that
  604: there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the
  605: garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses,
  606: and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two
  607: fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire
  608: about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in
  609: the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but
  610: whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."
  611: 
  612: "And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.
  613: 
  614: "Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is
  615: the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the
  616: Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,
  617: drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for
  618: dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.
  619: Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,
  620: handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and
  621: often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See
  622: the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him
  623: home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.
  624: When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up
  625: and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan
  626: of campaign.
  627: 
  628: "This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the
  629: matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the
  630: relation between them, and what the object of his repeated
  631: visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the
  632: former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his
  633: keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this
  634: question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony
  635: Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the
  636: Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my
  637: inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to
  638: let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the
  639: situation."
  640: 
  641: "I am following you closely," I answered.
  642: 
  643: "I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab
  644: drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a
  645: remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently
  646: the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a
  647: great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the
  648: maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly
  649: at home.
  650: 
  651: "He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch
  652: glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and
  653: down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see
  654: nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than
  655: before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from
  656: his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he
  657: shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to
  658: the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if
  659: you do it in twenty minutes!'
  660: 
  661: "Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do
  662: well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,
  663: the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under
  664: his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of
  665: the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall
  666: door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,
  667: but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.
  668: 
  669: "'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a
  670: sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'
  671: 
  672: "This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing
  673: whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her
  674: landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked
  675: twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could
  676: object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign
  677: if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to
  678: twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
  679: 
  680: "My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the
  681: others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their
  682: steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid
  683: the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there
  684: save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who
  685: seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three
  686: standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side
  687: aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.
  688: Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
  689: me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards
  690: me.
  691: 
  692: "'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'
  693: 
  694: "'What then?' I asked.
  695: 
  696: "'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'
  697: 
  698: "I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was
  699: I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,
  700: and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally
  701: assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to
  702: Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and
  703: there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady
  704: on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was
  705: the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my
  706: life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just
  707: now. It seems that there had been some informality about their
  708: license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them
  709: without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance
  710: saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in
  711: search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean
  712: to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion."
  713: 
  714: "This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what
  715: then?"
  716: 
  717: "Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if
  718: the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate
  719: very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church
  720: door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and
  721: she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as
  722: usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove
  723: away in different directions, and I went off to make my own
  724: arrangements."
  725: 
  726: "Which are?"
  727: 
  728: "Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the
  729: bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to
  730: be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want
  731: your co-operation."
  732: 
  733: "I shall be delighted."
  734: 
  735: "You don't mind breaking the law?"
  736: 
  737: "Not in the least."
  738: 
  739: "Nor running a chance of arrest?"
  740: 
  741: "Not in a good cause."
  742: 
  743: "Oh, the cause is excellent!"
  744: 
  745: "Then I am your man."
  746: 
  747: "I was sure that I might rely on you."
  748: 
  749: "But what is it you wish?"
  750: 
  751: "When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to
  752: you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that
  753: our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I
  754: have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must
  755: be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns
  756: from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."
  757: 
  758: "And what then?"
  759: 
  760: "You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to
  761: occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must
  762: not interfere, come what may. You understand?"
  763: 
  764: "I am to be neutral?"
  765: 
  766: "To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small
  767: unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being
  768: conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the
  769: sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close
  770: to that open window."
  771: 
  772: "Yes."
  773: 
  774: "You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."
  775: 
  776: "Yes."
  777: 
  778: "And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what
  779: I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of
  780: fire. You quite follow me?"
  781: 
  782: "Entirely."
  783: 
  784: "It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped
  785: roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket,
  786: fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.
  787: Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire,
  788: it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then
  789: walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten
  790: minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"
  791: 
  792: "I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,
  793: and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry
  794: of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."
  795: 
  796: "Precisely."
  797: 
  798: "Then you may entirely rely on me."
  799: 
  800: "That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I
  801: prepare for the new role I have to play."
  802: 
  803: He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in
  804: the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist
  805: clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white
  806: tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and
  807: benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have
  808: equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His
  809: expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every
  810: fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as
  811: science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in
  812: crime.
  813: 
  814: It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still
  815: wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in
  816: Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just
  817: being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,
  818: waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such
  819: as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description,
  820: but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On
  821: the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was
  822: remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men
  823: smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his
  824: wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and
  825: several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with
  826: cigars in their mouths.
  827: 
  828: "You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of
  829: the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The
  830: photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are
  831: that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey
  832: Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his
  833: princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the
  834: photograph?"
  835: 
  836: "Where, indeed?"
  837: 
  838: "It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is
  839: cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's
  840: dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid
  841: and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We
  842: may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."
  843: 
  844: "Where, then?"
  845: 
  846: "Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But
  847: I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive,
  848: and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it
  849: over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but
  850: she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be
  851: brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she
  852: had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she
  853: can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."
  854: 
  855: "But it has twice been burgled."
  856: 
  857: "Pshaw! They did not know how to look."
  858: 
  859: "But how will you look?"
  860: 
  861: "I will not look."
  862: 
  863: "What then?"
  864: 
  865: "I will get her to show me."
  866: 
  867: "But she will refuse."
  868: 
  869: "She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is
  870: her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."
  871: 
  872: As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round
  873: the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which
  874: rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of
  875: the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in
  876: the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another
  877: loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce
  878: quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who
  879: took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder,
  880: who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and
  881: in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was
  882: the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who
  883: struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes
  884: dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached
  885: her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood
  886: running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to
  887: their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while
  888: a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle
  889: without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to
  890: attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her,
  891: had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her
  892: superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking
  893: back into the street.
  894: 
  895: "Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.
  896: 
  897: "He is dead," cried several voices.
  898: 
  899: "No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be
  900: gone before you can get him to hospital."
  901: 
  902: "He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the
  903: lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a
  904: gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."
  905: 
  906: "He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"
  907: 
  908: "Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable
  909: sofa. This way, please!"
  910: 
  911: Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out
  912: in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings
  913: from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the
  914: blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay
  915: upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with
  916: compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I
  917: know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life
  918: than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was
  919: conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited
  920: upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery
  921: to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted
  922: to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under
  923: my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are
  924: but preventing her from injuring another.
  925: 
  926: Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man
  927: who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the
  928: window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the
  929: signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The
  930: word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of
  931: spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and
  932: servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds
  933: of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I
  934: caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice
  935: of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.
  936: Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner
  937: of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my
  938: friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.
  939: He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we
  940: had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the
  941: Edgeware Road.
  942: 
  943: "You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could
  944: have been better. It is all right."
  945: 
  946: "You have the photograph?"
  947: 
  948: "I know where it is."
  949: 
  950: "And how did you find out?"
  951: 
  952: "She showed me, as I told you she would."
  953: 
  954: "I am still in the dark."
  955: 
  956: "I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter
  957: was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the
  958: street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."
  959: 
  960: "I guessed as much."
  961: 
  962: "Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in
  963: the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand
  964: to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."
  965: 
  966: "That also I could fathom."
  967: 
  968: "Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else
  969: could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room
  970: which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was
  971: determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for
  972: air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your
  973: chance."
  974: 
  975: "How did that help you?"
  976: 
  977: "It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on
  978: fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she
  979: values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have
  980: more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the
  981: Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in
  982: the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby;
  983: an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to
  984: me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious
  985: to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it.
  986: The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were
  987: enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The
  988: photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the
  989: right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a
  990: glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it
  991: was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed
  992: from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making
  993: my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to
  994: attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had
  995: come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to
  996: wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."
  997: 
  998: "And now?" I asked.
  999: 
 1000: "Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King
 1001: to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be
 1002: shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is
 1003: probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the
 1004: photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain
 1005: it with his own hands."
 1006: 
 1007: "And when will you call?"
 1008: 
 1009: "At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall
 1010: have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage
 1011: may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to
 1012: the King without delay."
 1013: 
 1014: We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was
 1015: searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
 1016: 
 1017: "Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."
 1018: 
 1019: There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the
 1020: greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had
 1021: hurried by.
 1022: 
 1023: "I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the
 1024: dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have
 1025: been."
 1026: 
 1027: 
 1028: III.
 1029: 
 1030: I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our
 1031: toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed
 1032: into the room.
 1033: 
 1034: "You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by
 1035: either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
 1036: 
 1037: "Not yet."
 1038: 
 1039: "But you have hopes?"
 1040: 
 1041: "I have hopes."
 1042: 
 1043: "Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."
 1044: 
 1045: "We must have a cab."
 1046: 
 1047: "No, my brougham is waiting."
 1048: 
 1049: "Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off
 1050: once more for Briony Lodge.
 1051: 
 1052: "Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.
 1053: 
 1054: "Married! When?"
 1055: 
 1056: "Yesterday."
 1057: 
 1058: "But to whom?"
 1059: 
 1060: "To an English lawyer named Norton."
 1061: 
 1062: "But she could not love him."
 1063: 
 1064: "I am in hopes that she does."
 1065: 
 1066: "And why in hopes?"
 1067: 
 1068: "Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future
 1069: annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your
 1070: Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason
 1071: why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."
 1072: 
 1073: "It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own
 1074: station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a
 1075: moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in
 1076: Serpentine Avenue.
 1077: 
 1078: The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood
 1079: upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped
 1080: from the brougham.
 1081: 
 1082: "Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.
 1083: 
 1084: "I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a
 1085: questioning and rather startled gaze.
 1086: 
 1087: "Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She
 1088: left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing
 1089: Cross for the Continent."
 1090: 
 1091: "What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and
 1092: surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"
 1093: 
 1094: "Never to return."
 1095: 
 1096: "And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."
 1097: 
 1098: "We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
 1099: drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was
 1100: scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and
 1101: open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before
 1102: her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small
 1103: sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a
 1104: photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler
 1105: herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to
 1106: "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend
 1107: tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at
 1108: midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
 1109: 
 1110: "MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You
 1111: took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a
 1112: suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I
 1113: began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had
 1114: been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly
 1115: be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,
 1116: you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became
 1117: suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind
 1118: old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress
 1119: myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage
 1120: of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to
 1121: watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call
 1122: them, and came down just as you departed.
 1123: 
 1124: "Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
 1125: really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock
 1126: Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and
 1127: started for the Temple to see my husband.
 1128: 
 1129: "We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by
 1130: so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when
 1131: you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in
 1132: peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may
 1133: do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
 1134: wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a
 1135: weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
 1136: take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to
 1137: possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
 1138: 
 1139:                                       "Very truly yours,
 1140:                                    "IRENE NORTON, nÃ©e ADLER."
 1141: 
 1142: "What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when
 1143: we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick
 1144: and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?
 1145: Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"
 1146: 
 1147: "From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a
 1148: very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am
 1149: sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business
 1150: to a more successful conclusion."
 1151: 
 1152: "On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be
 1153: more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The
 1154: photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."
 1155: 
 1156: "I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."
 1157: 
 1158: "I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can
 1159: reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from
 1160: his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
 1161: 
 1162: "Your Majesty has something which I should value even more
 1163: highly," said Holmes.
 1164: 
 1165: "You have but to name it."
 1166: 
 1167: "This photograph!"
 1168: 
 1169: The King stared at him in amazement.
 1170: 
 1171: "Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."
 1172: 
 1173: "I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the
 1174: matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning." He
 1175: bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the
 1176: King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his
 1177: chambers.
 1178: 
 1179: And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom
 1180: of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were
 1181: beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the
 1182: cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And
 1183: when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her
 1184: photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.
 1185: 
 1186: 
 1187: 
 1188: ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
 1189: 
 1190: I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the
 1191: autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a
 1192: very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.
 1193: With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when
 1194: Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door
 1195: behind me.
 1196: 
 1197: "You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear
 1198: Watson," he said cordially.
 1199: 
 1200: "I was afraid that you were engaged."
 1201: 
 1202: "So I am. Very much so."
 1203: 
 1204: "Then I can wait in the next room."
 1205: 
 1206: "Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and
 1207: helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no
 1208: doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."
 1209: 
 1210: The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
 1211: greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small
 1212: fat-encircled eyes.
 1213: 
 1214: "Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and
 1215: putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in
 1216: judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love
 1217: of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum
 1218: routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by
 1219: the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you
 1220: will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own
 1221: little adventures."
 1222: 
 1223: "Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I
 1224: observed.
 1225: 
 1226: "You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we
 1227: went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary
 1228: Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary
 1229: combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more
 1230: daring than any effort of the imagination."
 1231: 
 1232: "A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."
 1233: 
 1234: "You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my
 1235: view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you
 1236: until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to
 1237: be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call
 1238: upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to
 1239: be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some
 1240: time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique
 1241: things are very often connected not with the larger but with the
 1242: smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for
 1243: doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I
 1244: have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present
 1245: case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is
 1246: certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.
 1247: Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to
 1248: recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend
 1249: Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the
 1250: peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every
 1251: possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some
 1252: slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide
 1253: myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my
 1254: memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the
 1255: facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."
 1256: 
 1257: The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
 1258: little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the
 1259: inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the
 1260: advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper
 1261: flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and
 1262: endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the
 1263: indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.
 1264: 
 1265: I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor
 1266: bore every mark of being an average commonplace British
 1267: tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey
 1268: shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat,
 1269: unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy
 1270: Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as
 1271: an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a
 1272: wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether,
 1273: look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save
 1274: his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and
 1275: discontent upon his features.
 1276: 
 1277: Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook
 1278: his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.
 1279: "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual
 1280: labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has
 1281: been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of
 1282: writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."
 1283: 
 1284: Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger
 1285: upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
 1286: 
 1287: "How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.
 1288: Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did
 1289: manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's
 1290: carpenter."
 1291: 
 1292: "Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger
 1293: than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more
 1294: developed."
 1295: 
 1296: "Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"
 1297: 
 1298: "I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,
 1299: especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you
 1300: use an arc-and-compass breastpin."
 1301: 
 1302: "Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"
 1303: 
 1304: "What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for
 1305: five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the
 1306: elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"
 1307: 
 1308: "Well, but China?"
 1309: 
 1310: "The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right
 1311: wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small
 1312: study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature
 1313: of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a
 1314: delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I
 1315: see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter
 1316: becomes even more simple."
 1317: 
 1318: Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I
 1319: thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see
 1320: that there was nothing in it, after all."
 1321: 
 1322: "I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake
 1323: in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my
 1324: poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I
 1325: am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"
 1326: 
 1327: "Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger
 1328: planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began
 1329: it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."
 1330: 
 1331: I took the paper from him and read as follows:
 1332: 
 1333: "TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late
 1334: Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now
 1335: another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a
 1336: salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. All
 1337: red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age
 1338: of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at
 1339: eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7
 1340: Pope's Court, Fleet Street."
 1341: 
 1342: "What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice
 1343: read over the extraordinary announcement.
 1344: 
 1345: Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when
 1346: in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?"
 1347: said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us
 1348: all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this
 1349: advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note,
 1350: Doctor, of the paper and the date."
 1351: 
 1352: "It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months
 1353: ago."
 1354: 
 1355: "Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"
 1356: 
 1357: "Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock
 1358: Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small
 1359: pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a
 1360: very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than
 1361: just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants,
 1362: but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but
 1363: that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the
 1364: business."
 1365: 
 1366: "What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.
 1367: 
 1368: "His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth,
 1369: either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter
 1370: assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better
 1371: himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after
 1372: all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"
 1373: 
 1374: "Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employÃ© who
 1375: comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience
 1376: among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is
 1377: not as remarkable as your advertisement."
 1378: 
 1379: "Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a
 1380: fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought
 1381: to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar
 1382: like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his
 1383: main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice
 1384: in him."
 1385: 
 1386: "He is still with you, I presume?"
 1387: 
 1388: "Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple
 1389: cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the
 1390: house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very
 1391: quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads
 1392: and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.
 1393: 
 1394: "The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.
 1395: Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight
 1396: weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:
 1397: 
 1398: "'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'
 1399: 
 1400: "'Why that?' I asks.
 1401: 
 1402: "'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the
 1403: Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who
 1404: gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than
 1405: there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what
 1406: to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's
 1407: a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'
 1408: 
 1409: "'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a
 1410: very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of
 1411: my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting
 1412: my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what
 1413: was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.
 1414: 
 1415: "'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he
 1416: asked with his eyes open.
 1417: 
 1418: "'Never.'
 1419: 
 1420: "'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one
 1421: of the vacancies.'
 1422: 
 1423: "'And what are they worth?' I asked.
 1424: 
 1425: "'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight,
 1426: and it need not interfere very much with one's other
 1427: occupations.'
 1428: 
 1429: "Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears,
 1430: for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an
 1431: extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.
 1432: 
 1433: "'Tell me all about it,' said I.
 1434: 
 1435: "'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for
 1436: yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address
 1437: where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out,
 1438: the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah
 1439: Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself
 1440: red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;
 1441: so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous
 1442: fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the
 1443: interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of
 1444: that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to
 1445: do.'
 1446: 
 1447: "'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who
 1448: would apply.'
 1449: 
 1450: "'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is
 1451: really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had
 1452: started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the
 1453: old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your
 1454: applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but
 1455: real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.
 1456: Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be
 1457: worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a
 1458: few hundred pounds.'
 1459: 
 1460: "Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,
 1461: that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed
 1462: to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I
 1463: stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent
 1464: Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might
 1465: prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for
 1466: the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to
 1467: have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for
 1468: the address that was given us in the advertisement.
 1469: 
 1470: "I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From
 1471: north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in
 1472: his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.
 1473: Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court
 1474: looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought
 1475: there were so many in the whole country as were brought together
 1476: by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they
 1477: were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay;
 1478: but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real
 1479: vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I
 1480: would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear
 1481: of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and
 1482: pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up
 1483: to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream
 1484: upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back
 1485: dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found
 1486: ourselves in the office."
 1487: 
 1488: "Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked
 1489: Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge
 1490: pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."
 1491: 
 1492: "There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs
 1493: and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that
 1494: was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate
 1495: as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in
 1496: them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem
 1497: to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn
 1498: came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of
 1499: the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he
 1500: might have a private word with us.
 1501: 
 1502: "'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is
 1503: willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'
 1504: 
 1505: "'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has
 1506: every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so
 1507: fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and
 1508: gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he
 1509: plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my
 1510: success.
 1511: 
 1512: "'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will,
 1513: however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'
 1514: With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I
 1515: yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as
 1516: he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we
 1517: have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and
 1518: once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which
 1519: would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the
 1520: window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the
 1521: vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,
 1522: and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there
 1523: was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the
 1524: manager.
 1525: 
 1526: "'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of
 1527: the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are
 1528: you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'
 1529: 
 1530: "I answered that I had not.
 1531: 
 1532: "His face fell immediately.
 1533: 
 1534: "'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am
 1535: sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the
 1536: propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their
 1537: maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a
 1538: bachelor.'
 1539: 
 1540: "My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was
 1541: not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for
 1542: a few minutes he said that it would be all right.
 1543: 
 1544: "'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be
 1545: fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a
 1546: head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your
 1547: new duties?'
 1548: 
 1549: "'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,'
 1550: said I.
 1551: 
 1552: "'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding.
 1553: 'I should be able to look after that for you.'
 1554: 
 1555: "'What would be the hours?' I asked.
 1556: 
 1557: "'Ten to two.'
 1558: 
 1559: "Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.
 1560: Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just
 1561: before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in
 1562: the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man,
 1563: and that he would see to anything that turned up.
 1564: 
 1565: "'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'
 1566: 
 1567: "'Is 4 pounds a week.'
 1568: 
 1569: "'And the work?'
 1570: 
 1571: "'Is purely nominal.'
 1572: 
 1573: "'What do you call purely nominal?'
 1574: 
 1575: "'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the
 1576: building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole
 1577: position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You
 1578: don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office
 1579: during that time.'
 1580: 
 1581: "'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,'
 1582: said I.
 1583: 
 1584: "'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness
 1585: nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose
 1586: your billet.'
 1587: 
 1588: "'And the work?'
 1589: 
 1590: "'Is to copy out the "Encyclopaedia Britannica." There is the first
 1591: volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and
 1592: blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be
 1593: ready to-morrow?'
 1594: 
 1595: "'Certainly,' I answered.
 1596: 
 1597: "'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you
 1598: once more on the important position which you have been fortunate
 1599: enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with
 1600: my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased
 1601: at my own good fortune.
 1602: 
 1603: "Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in
 1604: low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the
 1605: whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its
 1606: object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past
 1607: belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay
 1608: such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the
 1609: 'Encyclopaedia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to
 1610: cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the
 1611: whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look
 1612: at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a
 1613: quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for
 1614: Pope's Court.
 1615: 
 1616: "Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as
 1617: possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross
 1618: was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off
 1619: upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from
 1620: time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he
 1621: bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had
 1622: written, and locked the door of the office after me.
 1623: 
 1624: "This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the
 1625: manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my
 1626: week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week
 1627: after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I
 1628: left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only
 1629: once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at
 1630: all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an
 1631: instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet
 1632: was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk
 1633: the loss of it.
 1634: 
 1635: "Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about
 1636: Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and
 1637: hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very
 1638: long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly
 1639: filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole
 1640: business came to an end."
 1641: 
 1642: "To an end?"
 1643: 
 1644: "Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as
 1645: usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a
 1646: little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the
 1647: panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."
 1648: 
 1649: He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet
 1650: of note-paper. It read in this fashion:
 1651: 
 1652:                   THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
 1653: 
 1654:                            IS
 1655: 
 1656:                         DISSOLVED.
 1657: 
 1658:                      October 9, 1890.
 1659: 
 1660: Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the
 1661: rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so
 1662: completely overtopped every other consideration that we both
 1663: burst out into a roar of laughter.
 1664: 
 1665: "I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our
 1666: client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can
 1667: do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."
 1668: 
 1669: "No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from
 1670: which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for
 1671: the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you
 1672: will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.
 1673: Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the
 1674: door?"
 1675: 
 1676: "I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called
 1677: at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything
 1678: about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant
 1679: living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me
 1680: what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had
 1681: never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan
 1682: Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.
 1683: 
 1684: "'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'
 1685: 
 1686: "'What, the red-headed man?'
 1687: 
 1688: "'Yes.'
 1689: 
 1690: "'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor
 1691: and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new
 1692: premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'
 1693: 
 1694: "'Where could I find him?'
 1695: 
 1696: "'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17
 1697: King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'
 1698: 
 1699: "I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was
 1700: a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever
 1701: heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."
 1702: 
 1703: "And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.
 1704: 
 1705: "I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
 1706: assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say
 1707: that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite
 1708: good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place
 1709: without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough
 1710: to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right
 1711: away to you."
 1712: 
 1713: "And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an
 1714: exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.
 1715: From what you have told me I think that it is possible that
 1716: graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."
 1717: 
 1718: "Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four
 1719: pound a week."
 1720: 
 1721: "As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do
 1722: not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary
 1723: league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some
 1724: 30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have
 1725: gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have
 1726: lost nothing by them."
 1727: 
 1728: "No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,
 1729: and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a
 1730: prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it
 1731: cost them two and thirty pounds."
 1732: 
 1733: "We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first,
 1734: one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who
 1735: first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he
 1736: been with you?"
 1737: 
 1738: "About a month then."
 1739: 
 1740: "How did he come?"
 1741: 
 1742: "In answer to an advertisement."
 1743: 
 1744: "Was he the only applicant?"
 1745: 
 1746: "No, I had a dozen."
 1747: 
 1748: "Why did you pick him?"
 1749: 
 1750: "Because he was handy and would come cheap."
 1751: 
 1752: "At half-wages, in fact."
 1753: 
 1754: "Yes."
 1755: 
 1756: "What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"
 1757: 
 1758: "Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
 1759: though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon
 1760: his forehead."
 1761: 
 1762: Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought
 1763: as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are
 1764: pierced for earrings?"
 1765: 
 1766: "Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he
 1767: was a lad."
 1768: 
 1769: "Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still
 1770: with you?"
 1771: 
 1772: "Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."
 1773: 
 1774: "And has your business been attended to in your absence?"
 1775: 
 1776: "Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a
 1777: morning."
 1778: 
 1779: "That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an
 1780: opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is
 1781: Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."
 1782: 
 1783: "Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what
 1784: do you make of it all?"
 1785: 
 1786: "I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most
 1787: mysterious business."
 1788: 
 1789: "As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less
 1790: mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless
 1791: crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is
 1792: the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this
 1793: matter."
 1794: 
 1795: "What are you going to do, then?" I asked.
 1796: 
 1797: "To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I
 1798: beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled
 1799: himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his
 1800: hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his
 1801: black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.
 1802: I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and
 1803: indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his
 1804: chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put
 1805: his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
 1806: 
 1807: "Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he
 1808: remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare
 1809: you for a few hours?"
 1810: 
 1811: "I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very
 1812: absorbing."
 1813: 
 1814: "Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City
 1815: first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that
 1816: there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is
 1817: rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is
 1818: introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"
 1819: 
 1820: We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short
 1821: walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular
 1822: story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky,
 1823: little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy
 1824: two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in
 1825: enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded
 1826: laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and
 1827: uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with
 1828: "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced
 1829: the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.
 1830: Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
 1831: and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between
 1832: puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down
 1833: again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally
 1834: he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously
 1835: upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up
 1836: to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a
 1837: bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step
 1838: in.
 1839: 
 1840: "Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would
 1841: go from here to the Strand."
 1842: 
 1843: "Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly,
 1844: closing the door.
 1845: 
 1846: "Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is,
 1847: in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring
 1848: I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known
 1849: something of him before."
 1850: 
 1851: "Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good
 1852: deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you
 1853: inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."
 1854: 
 1855: "Not him."
 1856: 
 1857: "What then?"
 1858: 
 1859: "The knees of his trousers."
 1860: 
 1861: "And what did you see?"
 1862: 
 1863: "What I expected to see."
 1864: 
 1865: "Why did you beat the pavement?"
 1866: 
 1867: "My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We
 1868: are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg
 1869: Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."
 1870: 
 1871: The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the
 1872: corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a
 1873: contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was
 1874: one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City
 1875: to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense
 1876: stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward,
 1877: while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of
 1878: pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line
 1879: of fine shops and stately business premises that they really
 1880: abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
 1881: which we had just quitted.
 1882: 
 1883: "Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing
 1884: along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the
 1885: houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of
 1886: London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little
 1887: newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank,
 1888: the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building
 1889: depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,
 1890: Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A
 1891: sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where
 1892: all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no
 1893: red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."
 1894: 
 1895: My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a
 1896: very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All
 1897: the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect
 1898: happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the
 1899: music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes
 1900: were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the
 1901: relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was
 1902: possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature
 1903: alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and
 1904: astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction
 1905: against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally
 1906: predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from
 1907: extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was
 1908: never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been
 1909: lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his
 1910: black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase
 1911: would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning
 1912: power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were
 1913: unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a
 1914: man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him
 1915: that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I
 1916: felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set
 1917: himself to hunt down.
 1918: 
 1919: "You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we
 1920: emerged.
 1921: 
 1922: "Yes, it would be as well."
 1923: 
 1924: "And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This
 1925: business at Coburg Square is serious."
 1926: 
 1927: "Why serious?"
 1928: 
 1929: "A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to
 1930: believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being
 1931: Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help
 1932: to-night."
 1933: 
 1934: "At what time?"
 1935: 
 1936: "Ten will be early enough."
 1937: 
 1938: "I shall be at Baker Street at ten."
 1939: 
 1940: "Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger,
 1941: so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his
 1942: hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the
 1943: crowd.
 1944: 
 1945: I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was
 1946: always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings
 1947: with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had
 1948: seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that
 1949: he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to
 1950: happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and
 1951: grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought
 1952: over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed
 1953: copier of the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg
 1954: Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.
 1955: What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
 1956: Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from
 1957: Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a
 1958: formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to
 1959: puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside
 1960: until night should bring an explanation.
 1961: 
 1962: It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my
 1963: way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker
 1964: Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered
 1965: the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering
 1966: his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men,
 1967: one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police
 1968: agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a
 1969: very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.
 1970: 
 1971: "Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his
 1972: pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.
 1973: "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me
 1974: introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in
 1975: to-night's adventure."
 1976: 
 1977: "We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in
 1978: his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for
 1979: starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do
 1980: the running down."
 1981: 
 1982: "I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,"
 1983: observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.
 1984: 
 1985: "You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said
 1986: the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which
 1987: are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical
 1988: and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It
 1989: is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of
 1990: the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly
 1991: correct than the official force."
 1992: 
 1993: "Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the
 1994: stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.
 1995: It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I
 1996: have not had my rubber."
 1997: 
 1998: "I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will
 1999: play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and
 2000: that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather,
 2001: the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will
 2002: be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."
 2003: 
 2004: "John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a
 2005: young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his
 2006: profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on
 2007: any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John
 2008: Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been
 2009: to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and
 2010: though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to
 2011: find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week,
 2012: and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.
 2013: I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him
 2014: yet."
 2015: 
 2016: "I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.
 2017: I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I
 2018: agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is
 2019: past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two
 2020: will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the
 2021: second."
 2022: 
 2023: Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
 2024: and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in
 2025: the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit
 2026: streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.
 2027: 
 2028: "We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow
 2029: Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the
 2030: matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is
 2031: not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.
 2032: He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as
 2033: tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we
 2034: are, and they are waiting for us."
 2035: 
 2036: We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had
 2037: found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and,
 2038: following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a
 2039: narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.
 2040: Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive
 2041: iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding
 2042: stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.
 2043: Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us
 2044: down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a
 2045: third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all
 2046: round with crates and massive boxes.
 2047: 
 2048: "You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he
 2049: held up the lantern and gazed about him.
 2050: 
 2051: "Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon
 2052: the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite
 2053: hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.
 2054: 
 2055: "I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes
 2056: severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our
 2057: expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit
 2058: down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"
 2059: 
 2060: The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a
 2061: very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his
 2062: knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,
 2063: began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few
 2064: seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again
 2065: and put his glass in his pocket.
 2066: 
 2067: "We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can
 2068: hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.
 2069: Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their
 2070: work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at
 2071: present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of
 2072: the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.
 2073: Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to
 2074: you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of
 2075: London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at
 2076: present."
 2077: 
 2078: "It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had
 2079: several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."
 2080: 
 2081: "Your French gold?"
 2082: 
 2083: "Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources
 2084: and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of
 2085: France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to
 2086: unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The
 2087: crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between
 2088: layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at
 2089: present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the
 2090: directors have had misgivings upon the subject."
 2091: 
 2092: "Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is
 2093: time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an
 2094: hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr.
 2095: Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."
 2096: 
 2097: "And sit in the dark?"
 2098: 
 2099: "I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and
 2100: I thought that, as we were a partie carrÃ©e, you might have your
 2101: rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have
 2102: gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And,
 2103: first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men,
 2104: and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us
 2105: some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate,
 2106: and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a
 2107: light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no
 2108: compunction about shooting them down."
 2109: 
 2110: I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case
 2111: behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front
 2112: of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute
 2113: darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot
 2114: metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready
 2115: to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked
 2116: up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and
 2117: subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the
 2118: vault.
 2119: 
 2120: "They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back
 2121: through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have
 2122: done what I asked you, Jones?"
 2123: 
 2124: "I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."
 2125: 
 2126: "Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent
 2127: and wait."
 2128: 
 2129: What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but
 2130: an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must
 2131: have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs
 2132: were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my
 2133: nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my
 2134: hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle
 2135: breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,
 2136: heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note
 2137: of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case
 2138: in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint
 2139: of a light.
 2140: 
 2141: At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then
 2142: it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,
 2143: without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand
 2144: appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the
 2145: centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the
 2146: hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then
 2147: it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark
 2148: again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between
 2149: the stones.
 2150: 
 2151: Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,
 2152: tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon
 2153: its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed
 2154: the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,
 2155: boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand
 2156: on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and
 2157: waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another
 2158: instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after
 2159: him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face
 2160: and a shock of very red hair.
 2161: 
 2162: "It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the
 2163: bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"
 2164: 
 2165: Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the
 2166: collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of
 2167: rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed
 2168: upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came
 2169: down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone
 2170: floor.
 2171: 
 2172: "It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no
 2173: chance at all."
 2174: 
 2175: "So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy
 2176: that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his
 2177: coat-tails."
 2178: 
 2179: "There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.
 2180: 
 2181: "Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I
 2182: must compliment you."
 2183: 
 2184: "And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new
 2185: and effective."
 2186: 
 2187: "You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker
 2188: at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the
 2189: derbies."
 2190: 
 2191: "I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,"
 2192: remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.
 2193: "You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have
 2194: the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and
 2195: 'please.'"
 2196: 
 2197: "All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would
 2198: you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry
 2199: your Highness to the police-station?"
 2200: 
 2201: "That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow
 2202: to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the
 2203: detective.
 2204: 
 2205: "Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them
 2206: from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or
 2207: repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated
 2208: in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts
 2209: at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."
 2210: 
 2211: "I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.
 2212: John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over
 2213: this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond
 2214: that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in
 2215: many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of
 2216: the Red-headed League."
 2217: 
 2218: 
 2219: "You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning
 2220: as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it
 2221: was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible
 2222: object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of
 2223: the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get
 2224: this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of
 2225: hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,
 2226: really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was
 2227: no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his
 2228: accomplice's hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw
 2229: him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?
 2230: They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary
 2231: office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and
 2232: together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the
 2233: week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for
 2234: half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive
 2235: for securing the situation."
 2236: 
 2237: "But how could you guess what the motive was?"
 2238: 
 2239: "Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a
 2240: mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The
 2241: man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his
 2242: house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and
 2243: such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something
 2244: out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's
 2245: fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the
 2246: cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then
 2247: I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I
 2248: had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in
 2249: London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which
 2250: took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once
 2251: more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel
 2252: to some other building.
 2253: 
 2254: "So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I
 2255: surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was
 2256: ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.
 2257: It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the
 2258: assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had
 2259: never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his
 2260: face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have
 2261: remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of
 2262: those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they
 2263: were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and
 2264: Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I
 2265: had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I
 2266: called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank
 2267: directors, with the result that you have seen."
 2268: 
 2269: "And how could you tell that they would make their attempt
 2270: to-night?" I asked.
 2271: 
 2272: "Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that
 2273: they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other
 2274: words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential
 2275: that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the
 2276: bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than
 2277: any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.
 2278: For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."
 2279: 
 2280: "You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned
 2281: admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings
 2282: true."
 2283: 
 2284: "It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already
 2285: feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort
 2286: to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little
 2287: problems help me to do so."
 2288: 
 2289: "And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.
 2290: 
 2291: He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of
 2292: some little use," he remarked. "'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre
 2293: c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."
 2294: 
 2295: 
 2296: 
 2297: ADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
 2298: 
 2299: "My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side
 2300: of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely
 2301: stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We
 2302: would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere
 2303: commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window
 2304: hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the
 2305: roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the
 2306: strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the
 2307: wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and
 2308: leading to the most outrÃ© results, it would make all fiction with
 2309: its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and
 2310: unprofitable."
 2311: 
 2312: "And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which
 2313: come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and
 2314: vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to
 2315: its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,
 2316: neither fascinating nor artistic."
 2317: 
 2318: "A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
 2319: realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the
 2320: police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the
 2321: platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an
 2322: observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend
 2323: upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."
 2324: 
 2325: I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking
 2326: so," I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser
 2327: and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout
 2328: three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is
 2329: strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper
 2330: from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the
 2331: first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his
 2332: wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without
 2333: reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of
 2334: course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the
 2335: bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of
 2336: writers could invent nothing more crude."
 2337: 
 2338: "Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,"
 2339: said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This
 2340: is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged
 2341: in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The
 2342: husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the
 2343: conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of
 2344: winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling
 2345: them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely
 2346: to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a
 2347: pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over
 2348: you in your example."
 2349: 
 2350: He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in
 2351: the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his
 2352: homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon
 2353: it.
 2354: 
 2355: "Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.
 2356: It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my
 2357: assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."
 2358: 
 2359: "And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which
 2360: sparkled upon his finger.
 2361: 
 2362: "It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in
 2363: which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it
 2364: even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of
 2365: my little problems."
 2366: 
 2367: "And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.
 2368: 
 2369: "Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of
 2370: interest. They are important, you understand, without being
 2371: interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in
 2372: unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation,
 2373: and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the
 2374: charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the
 2375: simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is
 2376: the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter
 2377: which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing
 2378: which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however,
 2379: that I may have something better before very many minutes are
 2380: over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."
 2381: 
 2382: He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted
 2383: blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.
 2384: Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite
 2385: there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck,
 2386: and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was
 2387: tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her
 2388: ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous,
 2389: hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated
 2390: backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove
 2391: buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves
 2392: the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp
 2393: clang of the bell.
 2394: 
 2395: "I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his
 2396: cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always
 2397: means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure
 2398: that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet
 2399: even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously
 2400: wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom
 2401: is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love
 2402: matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or
 2403: grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."
 2404: 
 2405: As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons
 2406: entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself
 2407: loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed
 2408: merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed
 2409: her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,
 2410: having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked
 2411: her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was
 2412: peculiar to him.
 2413: 
 2414: "Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a
 2415: little trying to do so much typewriting?"
 2416: 
 2417: "I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters
 2418: are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport
 2419: of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear
 2420: and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've
 2421: heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know
 2422: all that?"
 2423: 
 2424: "Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know
 2425: things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others
 2426: overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"
 2427: 
 2428: "I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege,
 2429: whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had
 2430: given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as
 2431: much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in
 2432: my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and
 2433: I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."
 2434: 
 2435: "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked
 2436: Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to
 2437: the ceiling.
 2438: 
 2439: Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss
 2440: Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said,
 2441: "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.
 2442: Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to
 2443: the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he
 2444: would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done,
 2445: it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away
 2446: to you."
 2447: 
 2448: "Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the
 2449: name is different."
 2450: 
 2451: "Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,
 2452: too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."
 2453: 
 2454: "And your mother is alive?"
 2455: 
 2456: "Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr.
 2457: Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and
 2458: a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father
 2459: was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy
 2460: business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the
 2461: foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the
 2462: business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.
 2463: They got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't
 2464: near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."
 2465: 
 2466: I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this
 2467: rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he
 2468: had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.
 2469: 
 2470: "Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the
 2471: business?"
 2472: 
 2473: "Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle
 2474: Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per
 2475: cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can
 2476: only touch the interest."
 2477: 
 2478: "You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so
 2479: large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the
 2480: bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in
 2481: every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely
 2482: upon an income of about 60 pounds."
 2483: 
 2484: "I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you
 2485: understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a
 2486: burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while
 2487: I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the
 2488: time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it
 2489: over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I
 2490: earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can
 2491: often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."
 2492: 
 2493: "You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes.
 2494: "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as
 2495: freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your
 2496: connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."
 2497: 
 2498: A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked
 2499: nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the
 2500: gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets
 2501: when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and
 2502: sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He
 2503: never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I
 2504: wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I
 2505: was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to
 2506: prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all
 2507: father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing
 2508: fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much
 2509: as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do,
 2510: he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,
 2511: mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it
 2512: was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."
 2513: 
 2514: "I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from
 2515: France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."
 2516: 
 2517: "Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and
 2518: shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying
 2519: anything to a woman, for she would have her way."
 2520: 
 2521: "I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a
 2522: gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."
 2523: 
 2524: "Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if
 2525: we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to
 2526: say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father
 2527: came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house
 2528: any more."
 2529: 
 2530: "No?"
 2531: 
 2532: "Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He
 2533: wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to
 2534: say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But
 2535: then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to
 2536: begin with, and I had not got mine yet."
 2537: 
 2538: "But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see
 2539: you?"
 2540: 
 2541: "Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer
 2542: wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each
 2543: other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he
 2544: used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so
 2545: there was no need for father to know."
 2546: 
 2547: "Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"
 2548: 
 2549: "Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that
 2550: we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in
 2551: Leadenhall Street--and--"
 2552: 
 2553: "What office?"
 2554: 
 2555: "That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."
 2556: 
 2557: "Where did he live, then?"
 2558: 
 2559: "He slept on the premises."
 2560: 
 2561: "And you don't know his address?"
 2562: 
 2563: "No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."
 2564: 
 2565: "Where did you address your letters, then?"
 2566: 
 2567: "To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called
 2568: for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be
 2569: chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady,
 2570: so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't
 2571: have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come
 2572: from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the
 2573: machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he
 2574: was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think
 2575: of."
 2576: 
 2577: "It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom
 2578: of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.
 2579: Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
 2580: 
 2581: "He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me
 2582: in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to
 2583: be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his
 2584: voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he
 2585: was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat,
 2586: and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always
 2587: well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just
 2588: as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."
 2589: 
 2590: "Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,
 2591: returned to France?"
 2592: 
 2593: "Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we
 2594: should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest
 2595: and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever
 2596: happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite
 2597: right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.
 2598: Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder
 2599: of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the
 2600: week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to
 2601: mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother
 2602: said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like
 2603: that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as
 2604: he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do
 2605: anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the
 2606: company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on
 2607: the very morning of the wedding."
 2608: 
 2609: "It missed him, then?"
 2610: 
 2611: "Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."
 2612: 
 2613: "Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for
 2614: the Friday. Was it to be in church?"
 2615: 
 2616: "Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near
 2617: King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.
 2618: Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were
 2619: two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a
 2620: four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the
 2621: street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler
 2622: drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and
 2623: when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one
 2624: there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become
 2625: of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was
 2626: last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything
 2627: since then to throw any light upon what became of him."
 2628: 
 2629: "It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said
 2630: Holmes.
 2631: 
 2632: "Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all
 2633: the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to
 2634: be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to
 2635: separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him,
 2636: and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed
 2637: strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since
 2638: gives a meaning to it."
 2639: 
 2640: "Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some
 2641: unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"
 2642: 
 2643: "Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he
 2644: would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw
 2645: happened."
 2646: 
 2647: "But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"
 2648: 
 2649: "None."
 2650: 
 2651: "One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"
 2652: 
 2653: "She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter
 2654: again."
 2655: 
 2656: "And your father? Did you tell him?"
 2657: 
 2658: "Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had
 2659: happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,
 2660: what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of
 2661: the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my
 2662: money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,
 2663: there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about
 2664: money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what
 2665: could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me
 2666: half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She
 2667: pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob
 2668: heavily into it.
 2669: 
 2670: "I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and
 2671: I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the
 2672: weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind
 2673: dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel
 2674: vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."
 2675: 
 2676: "Then you don't think I'll see him again?"
 2677: 
 2678: "I fear not."
 2679: 
 2680: "Then what has happened to him?"
 2681: 
 2682: "You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an
 2683: accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can
 2684: spare."
 2685: 
 2686: "I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she.
 2687: "Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."
 2688: 
 2689: "Thank you. And your address?"
 2690: 
 2691: "No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."
 2692: 
 2693: "Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your
 2694: father's place of business?"
 2695: 
 2696: "He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers
 2697: of Fenchurch Street."
 2698: 
 2699: "Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will
 2700: leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given
 2701: you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it
 2702: to affect your life."
 2703: 
 2704: "You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be
 2705: true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."
 2706: 
 2707: For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was
 2708: something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which
 2709: compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon
 2710: the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever
 2711: she might be summoned.
 2712: 
 2713: Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips
 2714: still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him,
 2715: and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down
 2716: from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a
 2717: counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with
 2718: the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of
 2719: infinite languor in his face.
 2720: 
 2721: "Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found
 2722: her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way,
 2723: is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you
 2724: consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of
 2725: the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however,
 2726: there were one or two details which were new to me. But the
 2727: maiden herself was most instructive."
 2728: 
 2729: "You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite
 2730: invisible to me," I remarked.
 2731: 
 2732: "Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to
 2733: look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring
 2734: you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of
 2735: thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.
 2736: Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe
 2737: it."
 2738: 
 2739: "Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a
 2740: feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads
 2741: sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her
 2742: dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little
 2743: purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and
 2744: were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't
 2745: observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a
 2746: general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable,
 2747: easy-going way."
 2748: 
 2749: Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
 2750: 
 2751: "'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have
 2752: really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed
 2753: everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and
 2754: you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general
 2755: impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My
 2756: first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is
 2757: perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you
 2758: observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most
 2759: useful material for showing traces. The double line a little
 2760: above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table,
 2761: was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,
 2762: leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side
 2763: of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the
 2764: broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and,
 2765: observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I
 2766: ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed
 2767: to surprise her."
 2768: 
 2769: "It surprised me."
 2770: 
 2771: "But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and
 2772: interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots
 2773: which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were
 2774: really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and
 2775: the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower
 2776: buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and
 2777: fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly
 2778: dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned,
 2779: it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."
 2780: 
 2781: "And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by
 2782: my friend's incisive reasoning.
 2783: 
 2784: "I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving
 2785: home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right
 2786: glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see
 2787: that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had
 2788: written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been
 2789: this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.
 2790: All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back
 2791: to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised
 2792: description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
 2793: 
 2794: I held the little printed slip to the light.
 2795: 
 2796: "Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman
 2797: named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height;
 2798: strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in
 2799: the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted
 2800: glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen,
 2801: in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert
 2802: chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over
 2803: elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in
 2804: Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"
 2805: 
 2806: "That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued,
 2807: glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no
 2808: clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There
 2809: is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike
 2810: you."
 2811: 
 2812: "They are typewritten," I remarked.
 2813: 
 2814: "Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the
 2815: neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you
 2816: see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is
 2817: rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in
 2818: fact, we may call it conclusive."
 2819: 
 2820: "Of what?"
 2821: 
 2822: "My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it
 2823: bears upon the case?"
 2824: 
 2825: "I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able
 2826: to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were
 2827: instituted."
 2828: 
 2829: "No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters,
 2830: which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the
 2831: other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking
 2832: him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow
 2833: evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the
 2834: male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the
 2835: answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem
 2836: upon the shelf for the interim."
 2837: 
 2838: I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers
 2839: of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that
 2840: he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy
 2841: demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had
 2842: been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in
 2843: the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler
 2844: photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the
 2845: Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with
 2846: the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle
 2847: indeed which he could not unravel.
 2848: 
 2849: I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the
 2850: conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would
 2851: find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up
 2852: to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary
 2853: Sutherland.
 2854: 
 2855: A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own
 2856: attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at
 2857: the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six
 2858: o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a
 2859: hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too
 2860: late to assist at the dÃ©nouement of the little mystery. I found
 2861: Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin
 2862: form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable
 2863: array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell
 2864: of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the
 2865: chemical work which was so dear to him.
 2866: 
 2867: "Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.
 2868: 
 2869: "Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."
 2870: 
 2871: "No, no, the mystery!" I cried.
 2872: 
 2873: "Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.
 2874: There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said
 2875: yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback
 2876: is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."
 2877: 
 2878: "Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss
 2879: Sutherland?"
 2880: 
 2881: The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet
 2882: opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the
 2883: passage and a tap at the door.
 2884: 
 2885: "This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said
 2886: Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at
 2887: six. Come in!"
 2888: 
 2889: The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some
 2890: thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a
 2891: bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and
 2892: penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of
 2893: us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a
 2894: slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.
 2895: 
 2896: "Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that
 2897: this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an
 2898: appointment with me for six o'clock?"
 2899: 
 2900: "Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not
 2901: quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland
 2902: has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far
 2903: better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite
 2904: against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable,
 2905: impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily
 2906: controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I
 2907: did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the
 2908: official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family
 2909: misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless
 2910: expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"
 2911: 
 2912: "On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to
 2913: believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."
 2914: 
 2915: Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am
 2916: delighted to hear it," he said.
 2917: 
 2918: "It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has
 2919: really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless
 2920: they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some
 2921: letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one
 2922: side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that
 2923: in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and
 2924: a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other
 2925: characteristics, but those are the more obvious."
 2926: 
 2927: "We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,
 2928: and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing
 2929: keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.
 2930: 
 2931: "And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,
 2932: Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another
 2933: little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its
 2934: relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some
 2935: little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come
 2936: from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not
 2937: only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will
 2938: observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen
 2939: other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."
 2940: 
 2941: Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I
 2942: cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,"
 2943: he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know
 2944: when you have done it."
 2945: 
 2946: "Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in
 2947: the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"
 2948: 
 2949: "What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips
 2950: and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
 2951: 
 2952: "Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There
 2953: is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too
 2954: transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that
 2955: it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's
 2956: right! Sit down and let us talk it over."
 2957: 
 2958: Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a
 2959: glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he
 2960: stammered.
 2961: 
 2962: "I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,
 2963: Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a
 2964: petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the
 2965: course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."
 2966: 
 2967: The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his
 2968: breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up
 2969: on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands
 2970: in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed,
 2971: than to us.
 2972: 
 2973: "The man married a woman very much older than himself for her
 2974: money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the
 2975: daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable
 2976: sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have
 2977: made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it.
 2978: The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate
 2979: and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with
 2980: her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would
 2981: not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would
 2982: mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her
 2983: stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of
 2984: keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of
 2985: people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not
 2986: answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and
 2987: finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain
 2988: ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an
 2989: idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the
 2990: connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself,
 2991: covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with
 2992: a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice
 2993: into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the
 2994: girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off
 2995: other lovers by making love himself."
 2996: 
 2997: "It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never
 2998: thought that she would have been so carried away."
 2999: 
 3000: "Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very
 3001: decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that
 3002: her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never
 3003: for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the
 3004: gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the
 3005: loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began
 3006: to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as
 3007: far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There
 3008: were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the
 3009: girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the
 3010: deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys
 3011: to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to
 3012: bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it
 3013: would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and
 3014: prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to
 3015: come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and
 3016: hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening
 3017: on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss
 3018: Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to
 3019: his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not
 3020: listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her,
 3021: and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished
 3022: away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a
 3023: four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of
 3024: events, Mr. Windibank!"
 3025: 
 3026: Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes
 3027: had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold
 3028: sneer upon his pale face.
 3029: 
 3030: "It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you
 3031: are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is
 3032: you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing
 3033: actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door
 3034: locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal
 3035: constraint."
 3036: 
 3037: "The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking
 3038: and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who
 3039: deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a
 3040: friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!"
 3041: he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon
 3042: the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but
 3043: here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat
 3044: myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he
 3045: could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,
 3046: the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr.
 3047: James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.
 3048: 
 3049: "There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he
 3050: threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will
 3051: rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and
 3052: ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not
 3053: entirely devoid of interest."
 3054: 
 3055: "I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I
 3056: remarked.
 3057: 
 3058: "Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.
 3059: Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious
 3060: conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really
 3061: profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the
 3062: stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together,
 3063: but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was
 3064: suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice,
 3065: which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My
 3066: suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in
 3067: typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his
 3068: handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even
 3069: the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,
 3070: together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same
 3071: direction."
 3072: 
 3073: "And how did you verify them?"
 3074: 
 3075: "Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I
 3076: knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed
 3077: description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the
 3078: result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I
 3079: sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me
 3080: whether it answered to the description of any of their
 3081: travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the
 3082: typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business
 3083: address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his
 3084: reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but
 3085: characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from
 3086: Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the
 3087: description tallied in every respect with that of their employÃ©,
 3088: James Windibank. VoilÃ  tout!"
 3089: 
 3090: "And Miss Sutherland?"
 3091: 
 3092: "If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old
 3093: Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger
 3094: cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.'
 3095: There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much
 3096: knowledge of the world."
 3097: 
 3098: 
 3099: 
 3100: ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
 3101: 
 3102: We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the
 3103: maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran
 3104: in this way:
 3105: 
 3106: "Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from
 3107: the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.
 3108: Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect.
 3109: Leave Paddington by the 11:15."
 3110: 
 3111: "What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me.
 3112: "Will you go?"
 3113: 
 3114: "I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at
 3115: present."
 3116: 
 3117: "Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking
 3118: a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,
 3119: and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."
 3120: 
 3121: "I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained
 3122: through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack
 3123: at once, for I have only half an hour."
 3124: 
 3125: My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the
 3126: effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were
 3127: few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a
 3128: cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock
 3129: Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt
 3130: figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey
 3131: travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
 3132: 
 3133: "It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It
 3134: makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on
 3135: whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless
 3136: or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall
 3137: get the tickets."
 3138: 
 3139: We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of
 3140: papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged
 3141: and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until
 3142: we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a
 3143: gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.
 3144: 
 3145: "Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.
 3146: 
 3147: "Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."
 3148: 
 3149: "The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just
 3150: been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
 3151: particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those
 3152: simple cases which are so extremely difficult."
 3153: 
 3154: "That sounds a little paradoxical."
 3155: 
 3156: "But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a
 3157: clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more
 3158: difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they
 3159: have established a very serious case against the son of the
 3160: murdered man."
 3161: 
 3162: "It is a murder, then?"
 3163: 
 3164: "Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for
 3165: granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into
 3166: it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have
 3167: been able to understand it, in a very few words.
 3168: 
 3169: "Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in
 3170: Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a
 3171: Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned
 3172: some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he
 3173: held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was
 3174: also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the
 3175: colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to
 3176: settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.
 3177: Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his
 3178: tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect
 3179: equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son,
 3180: a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same
 3181: age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have
 3182: avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to
 3183: have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of
 3184: sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the
 3185: neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.
 3186: Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the
 3187: least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the
 3188: families. Now for the facts.
 3189: 
 3190: "On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at
 3191: Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the
 3192: Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out
 3193: of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been
 3194: out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told
 3195: the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of
 3196: importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came
 3197: back alive.
 3198: 
 3199: "From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a
 3200: mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One
 3201: was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was
 3202: William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both
 3203: these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The
 3204: game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.
 3205: McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the
 3206: same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the
 3207: father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was
 3208: following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in
 3209: the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
 3210: 
 3211: "The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder,
 3212: the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly
 3213: wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the
 3214: edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of
 3215: the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the
 3216: woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she
 3217: saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.
 3218: McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a
 3219: violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very
 3220: strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his
 3221: hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their
 3222: violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached
 3223: home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near
 3224: Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to
 3225: fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came
 3226: running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead
 3227: in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was
 3228: much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right
 3229: hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On
 3230: following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the
 3231: grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated
 3232: blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as
 3233: might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's
 3234: gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the
 3235: body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly
 3236: arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned
 3237: at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the
 3238: magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next
 3239: Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out
 3240: before the coroner and the police-court."
 3241: 
 3242: "I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If
 3243: ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so
 3244: here."
 3245: 
 3246: "Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes
 3247: thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing,
 3248: but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it
 3249: pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something
 3250: entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case
 3251: looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very
 3252: possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people
 3253: in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the
 3254: daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his
 3255: innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect
 3256: in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in
 3257: his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the
 3258: case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are
 3259: flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly
 3260: digesting their breakfasts at home."
 3261: 
 3262: "I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you
 3263: will find little credit to be gained out of this case."
 3264: 
 3265: "There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he
 3266: answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some
 3267: other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to
 3268: Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting
 3269: when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by
 3270: means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of
 3271: understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly
 3272: perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand
 3273: side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted
 3274: even so self-evident a thing as that."
 3275: 
 3276: "How on earth--"
 3277: 
 3278: "My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness
 3279: which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this
 3280: season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less
 3281: and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until
 3282: it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the
 3283: jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated
 3284: than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking
 3285: at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a
 3286: result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and
 3287: inference. Therein lies my mÃ©tier, and it is just possible that
 3288: it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before
 3289: us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in
 3290: the inquest, and which are worth considering."
 3291: 
 3292: "What are they?"
 3293: 
 3294: "It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after
 3295: the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary
 3296: informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not
 3297: surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.
 3298: This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any
 3299: traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the
 3300: coroner's jury."
 3301: 
 3302: "It was a confession," I ejaculated.
 3303: 
 3304: "No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."
 3305: 
 3306: "Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at
 3307: least a most suspicious remark."
 3308: 
 3309: "On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I
 3310: can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,
 3311: he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the
 3312: circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared
 3313: surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I
 3314: should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such
 3315: surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,
 3316: and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His
 3317: frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent
 3318: man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and
 3319: firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not
 3320: unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of
 3321: his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day
 3322: so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and
 3323: even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so
 3324: important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The
 3325: self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark
 3326: appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a
 3327: guilty one."
 3328: 
 3329: I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter
 3330: evidence," I remarked.
 3331: 
 3332: "So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."
 3333: 
 3334: "What is the young man's own account of the matter?"
 3335: 
 3336: "It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,
 3337: though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.
 3338: You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."
 3339: 
 3340: He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire
 3341: paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the
 3342: paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own
 3343: statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the
 3344: corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this
 3345: way:
 3346: 
 3347: "Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called
 3348: and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for
 3349: three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the
 3350: morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at
 3351: the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he
 3352: had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after
 3353: my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,
 3354: looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out
 3355: of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was
 3356: going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of
 3357: the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit
 3358: warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William
 3359: Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but
 3360: he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had
 3361: no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards
 3362: from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal
 3363: between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found
 3364: him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at
 3365: seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A
 3366: conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows,
 3367: for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his
 3368: passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned
 3369: towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,
 3370: however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me
 3371: to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground,
 3372: with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in
 3373: my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for
 3374: some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper,
 3375: his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one
 3376: near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by
 3377: his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and
 3378: forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no
 3379: active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'
 3380: 
 3381: "The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before
 3382: he died?
 3383: 
 3384: "Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some
 3385: allusion to a rat.
 3386: 
 3387: "The Coroner: What did you understand by that?
 3388: 
 3389: "Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was
 3390: delirious.
 3391: 
 3392: "The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father
 3393: had this final quarrel?
 3394: 
 3395: "Witness: I should prefer not to answer.
 3396: 
 3397: "The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.
 3398: 
 3399: "Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can
 3400: assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which
 3401: followed.
 3402: 
 3403: "The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point
 3404: out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case
 3405: considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.
 3406: 
 3407: "Witness: I must still refuse.
 3408: 
 3409: "The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common
 3410: signal between you and your father?
 3411: 
 3412: "Witness: It was.
 3413: 
 3414: "The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw
 3415: you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?
 3416: 
 3417: "Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.
 3418: 
 3419: "A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions
 3420: when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father
 3421: fatally injured?
 3422: 
 3423: "Witness: Nothing definite.
 3424: 
 3425: "The Coroner: What do you mean?
 3426: 
 3427: "Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into
 3428: the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet
 3429: I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay
 3430: upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be
 3431: something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.
 3432: When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was
 3433: gone.
 3434: 
 3435: "'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'
 3436: 
 3437: "'Yes, it was gone.'
 3438: 
 3439: "'You cannot say what it was?'
 3440: 
 3441: "'No, I had a feeling something was there.'
 3442: 
 3443: "'How far from the body?'
 3444: 
 3445: "'A dozen yards or so.'
 3446: 
 3447: "'And how far from the edge of the wood?'
 3448: 
 3449: "'About the same.'
 3450: 
 3451: "'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen
 3452: yards of it?'
 3453: 
 3454: "'Yes, but with my back towards it.'
 3455: 
 3456: "This concluded the examination of the witness."
 3457: 
 3458: "I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner
 3459: in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.
 3460: He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his
 3461: father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his
 3462: refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and
 3463: his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all,
 3464: as he remarks, very much against the son."
 3465: 
 3466: Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon
 3467: the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some
 3468: pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the
 3469: young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him
 3470: credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too
 3471: little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would
 3472: give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from
 3473: his own inner consciousness anything so outrÃ© as a dying
 3474: reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No,
 3475: sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what
 3476: this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that
 3477: hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and
 3478: not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the
 3479: scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be
 3480: there in twenty minutes."
 3481: 
 3482: It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through
 3483: the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,
 3484: found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A
 3485: lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for
 3486: us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and
 3487: leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic
 3488: surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of
 3489: Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a
 3490: room had already been engaged for us.
 3491: 
 3492: "I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup
 3493: of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be
 3494: happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."
 3495: 
 3496: "It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It
 3497: is entirely a question of barometric pressure."
 3498: 
 3499: Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.
 3500: 
 3501: "How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud
 3502: in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need
 3503: smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country
 3504: hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I
 3505: shall use the carriage to-night."
 3506: 
 3507: Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed
 3508: your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as
 3509: plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer
 3510: it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a
 3511: very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your
 3512: opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing
 3513: which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my
 3514: soul! here is her carriage at the door."
 3515: 
 3516: He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the
 3517: most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her
 3518: violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her
 3519: cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her
 3520: overpowering excitement and concern.
 3521: 
 3522: "Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the
 3523: other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition,
 3524: fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I
 3525: have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it.
 3526: I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it,
 3527: too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each
 3528: other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no
 3529: one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a
 3530: charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."
 3531: 
 3532: "I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes.
 3533: "You may rely upon my doing all that I can."
 3534: 
 3535: "But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion?
 3536: Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself
 3537: think that he is innocent?"
 3538: 
 3539: "I think that it is very probable."
 3540: 
 3541: "There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking
 3542: defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."
 3543: 
 3544: Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague
 3545: has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.
 3546: 
 3547: "But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did
 3548: it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the
 3549: reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because
 3550: I was concerned in it."
 3551: 
 3552: "In what way?" asked Holmes.
 3553: 
 3554: "It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had
 3555: many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that
 3556: there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always
 3557: loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young
 3558: and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he
 3559: naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there
 3560: were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."
 3561: 
 3562: "And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a
 3563: union?"
 3564: 
 3565: "No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in
 3566: favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as
 3567: Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.
 3568: 
 3569: "Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father
 3570: if I call to-morrow?"
 3571: 
 3572: "I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."
 3573: 
 3574: "The doctor?"
 3575: 
 3576: "Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for
 3577: years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken
 3578: to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his
 3579: nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive
 3580: who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."
 3581: 
 3582: "Ha! In Victoria! That is important."
 3583: 
 3584: "Yes, at the mines."
 3585: 
 3586: "Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner
 3587: made his money."
 3588: 
 3589: "Yes, certainly."
 3590: 
 3591: "Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to
 3592: me."
 3593: 
 3594: "You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you
 3595: will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do
 3596: tell him that I know him to be innocent."
 3597: 
 3598: "I will, Miss Turner."
 3599: 
 3600: "I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if
 3601: I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She
 3602: hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we
 3603: heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.
 3604: 
 3605: "I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a
 3606: few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you
 3607: are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I
 3608: call it cruel."
 3609: 
 3610: "I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said
 3611: Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"
 3612: 
 3613: "Yes, but only for you and me."
 3614: 
 3615: "Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have
 3616: still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"
 3617: 
 3618: "Ample."
 3619: 
 3620: "Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very
 3621: slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."
 3622: 
 3623: I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through
 3624: the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel,
 3625: where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a
 3626: yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,
 3627: however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were
 3628: groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the
 3629: action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and
 3630: gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the
 3631: day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were
 3632: absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely
 3633: unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between
 3634: the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,
 3635: drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was
 3636: something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the
 3637: nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?
 3638: I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which
 3639: contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's
 3640: deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left
 3641: parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
 3642: shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot
 3643: upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from
 3644: behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when
 3645: seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it
 3646: did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his
 3647: back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call
 3648: Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying
 3649: reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be
 3650: delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become
 3651: delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how
 3652: he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my
 3653: brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident
 3654: of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the
 3655: murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his
 3656: overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to
 3657: return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was
 3658: kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a
 3659: tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I
 3660: did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith
 3661: in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long
 3662: as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young
 3663: McCarthy's innocence.
 3664: 
 3665: It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,
 3666: for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.
 3667: 
 3668: "The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down.
 3669: "It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able
 3670: to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his
 3671: very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not
 3672: wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young
 3673: McCarthy."
 3674: 
 3675: "And what did you learn from him?"
 3676: 
 3677: "Nothing."
 3678: 
 3679: "Could he throw no light?"
 3680: 
 3681: "None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew
 3682: who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced
 3683: now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very
 3684: quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,
 3685: sound at heart."
 3686: 
 3687: "I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact
 3688: that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as
 3689: this Miss Turner."
 3690: 
 3691: "Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,
 3692: insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was
 3693: only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away
 3694: five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get
 3695: into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a
 3696: registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can
 3697: imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not
 3698: doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows
 3699: to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort
 3700: which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father,
 3701: at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss
 3702: Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself,
 3703: and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would
 3704: have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with
 3705: his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in
 3706: Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that
 3707: point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however,
 3708: for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious
 3709: trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and
 3710: has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the
 3711: Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I
 3712: think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all
 3713: that he has suffered."
 3714: 
 3715: "But if he is innocent, who has done it?"
 3716: 
 3717: "Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two
 3718: points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with
 3719: someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his
 3720: son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would
 3721: return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry
 3722: 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the
 3723: crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk
 3724: about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all
 3725: minor matters until to-morrow."
 3726: 
 3727: There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke
 3728: bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with
 3729: the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe
 3730: Pool.
 3731: 
 3732: "There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is
 3733: said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is
 3734: despaired of."
 3735: 
 3736: "An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.
 3737: 
 3738: "About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life
 3739: abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This
 3740: business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend
 3741: of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I
 3742: have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."
 3743: 
 3744: "Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.
 3745: 
 3746: "Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody
 3747: about here speaks of his kindness to him."
 3748: 
 3749: "Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this
 3750: McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have
 3751: been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of
 3752: marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably,
 3753: heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner,
 3754: as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would
 3755: follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself
 3756: was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not
 3757: deduce something from that?"
 3758: 
 3759: "We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said
 3760: Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts,
 3761: Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."
 3762: 
 3763: "You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard
 3764: to tackle the facts."
 3765: 
 3766: "Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it
 3767: difficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.
 3768: 
 3769: "And that is--"
 3770: 
 3771: "That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that
 3772: all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."
 3773: 
 3774: "Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes,
 3775: laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley
 3776: Farm upon the left."
 3777: 
 3778: "Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking
 3779: building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches
 3780: of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless
 3781: chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight
 3782: of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,
 3783: when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her
 3784: master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the
 3785: son's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured
 3786: these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes
 3787: desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed
 3788: the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.
 3789: 
 3790: Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent
 3791: as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of
 3792: Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed
 3793: and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,
 3794: while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.
 3795: His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips
 3796: compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,
 3797: sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal
 3798: lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated
 3799: upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell
 3800: unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,
 3801: impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way
 3802: along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of
 3803: the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is
 3804: all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon
 3805: the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either
 3806: side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and
 3807: once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and
 3808: I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous,
 3809: while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the
 3810: conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a
 3811: definite end.
 3812: 
 3813: The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water
 3814: some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the
 3815: Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.
 3816: Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see
 3817: the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich
 3818: landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods
 3819: grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass
 3820: twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
 3821: which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which
 3822: the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,
 3823: that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the
 3824: fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager
 3825: face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read
 3826: upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking
 3827: up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.
 3828: 
 3829: "What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.
 3830: 
 3831: "I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon
 3832: or other trace. But how on earth--"
 3833: 
 3834: "Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its
 3835: inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and
 3836: there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all
 3837: have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo
 3838: and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the
 3839: lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or
 3840: eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of
 3841: the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his
 3842: waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to
 3843: himself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he
 3844: was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are
 3845: deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his
 3846: story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are
 3847: the father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It
 3848: is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?
 3849: Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite
 3850: unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course
 3851: that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up
 3852: and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we
 3853: were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a
 3854: great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced
 3855: his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
 3856: his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he
 3857: remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,
 3858: gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and
 3859: examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of
 3860: the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among
 3861: the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then
 3862: he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the
 3863: highroad, where all traces were lost.
 3864: 
 3865: "It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked,
 3866: returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on
 3867: the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a
 3868: word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done
 3869: that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,
 3870: and I shall be with you presently."
 3871: 
 3872: It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove
 3873: back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he
 3874: had picked up in the wood.
 3875: 
 3876: "This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out.
 3877: "The murder was done with it."
 3878: 
 3879: "I see no marks."
 3880: 
 3881: "There are none."
 3882: 
 3883: "How do you know, then?"
 3884: 
 3885: "The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few
 3886: days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It
 3887: corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other
 3888: weapon."
 3889: 
 3890: "And the murderer?"
 3891: 
 3892: "Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears
 3893: thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian
 3894: cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his
 3895: pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be
 3896: enough to aid us in our search."
 3897: 
 3898: Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he
 3899: said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a
 3900: hard-headed British jury."
 3901: 
 3902: "Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own
 3903: method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon,
 3904: and shall probably return to London by the evening train."
 3905: 
 3906: "And leave your case unfinished?"
 3907: 
 3908: "No, finished."
 3909: 
 3910: "But the mystery?"
 3911: 
 3912: "It is solved."
 3913: 
 3914: "Who was the criminal, then?"
 3915: 
 3916: "The gentleman I describe."
 3917: 
 3918: "But who is he?"
 3919: 
 3920: "Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a
 3921: populous neighbourhood."
 3922: 
 3923: Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said,
 3924: "and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking
 3925: for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the
 3926: laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."
 3927: 
 3928: "All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance.
 3929: Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before
 3930: I leave."
 3931: 
 3932: Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where
 3933: we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in
 3934: thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds
 3935: himself in a perplexing position.
 3936: 
 3937: "Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit
 3938: down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't
 3939: know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a
 3940: cigar and let me expound."
 3941: 
 3942:  "Pray do so."
 3943: 
 3944: "Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about
 3945: young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly,
 3946: although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One
 3947: was the fact that his father should, according to his account,
 3948: cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying
 3949: reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but
 3950: that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double
 3951: point our research must commence, and we will begin it by
 3952: presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."
 3953: 
 3954: "What of this 'Cooee!' then?"
 3955: 
 3956: "Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The
 3957: son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that
 3958: he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the
 3959: attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But
 3960: 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used
 3961: between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the
 3962: person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was
 3963: someone who had been in Australia."
 3964: 
 3965: "What of the rat, then?"
 3966: 
 3967: Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened
 3968: it out on the table. "This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,"
 3969: he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand
 3970: over part of the map. "What do you read?"
 3971: 
 3972: "ARAT," I read.
 3973: 
 3974: "And now?" He raised his hand.
 3975: 
 3976: "BALLARAT."
 3977: 
 3978: "Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his
 3979: son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter
 3980: the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."
 3981: 
 3982: "It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.
 3983: 
 3984: "It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down
 3985: considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point
 3986: which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a
 3987: certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite
 3988: conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."
 3989: 
 3990: "Certainly."
 3991: 
 3992: "And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only
 3993: be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could
 3994: hardly wander."
 3995: 
 3996: "Quite so."
 3997: 
 3998: "Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the
 3999: ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that
 4000: imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."
 4001: 
 4002: "But how did you gain them?"
 4003: 
 4004: "You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of
 4005: trifles."
 4006: 
 4007: "His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length
 4008: of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces."
 4009: 
 4010: "Yes, they were peculiar boots."
 4011: 
 4012: "But his lameness?"
 4013: 
 4014: "The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than
 4015: his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he
 4016: was lame."
 4017: 
 4018: "But his left-handedness."
 4019: 
 4020: "You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded
 4021: by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from
 4022: immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can
 4023: that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind
 4024: that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had
 4025: even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special
 4026: knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian
 4027: cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and
 4028: written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different
 4029: varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the
 4030: ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
 4031: where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety
 4032: which are rolled in Rotterdam."
 4033: 
 4034: "And the cigar-holder?"
 4035: 
 4036: "I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he
 4037: used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the
 4038: cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."
 4039: 
 4040: "Holmes," I said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which
 4041: he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as
 4042: truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the
 4043: direction in which all this points. The culprit is--"
 4044: 
 4045: "Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of
 4046: our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.
 4047: 
 4048: The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His
 4049: slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of
 4050: decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and
 4051: his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual
 4052: strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled
 4053: hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air
 4054: of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an
 4055: ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were
 4056: tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that
 4057: he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.
 4058: 
 4059: "Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my
 4060: note?"
 4061: 
 4062: "Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to
 4063: see me here to avoid scandal."
 4064: 
 4065: "I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."
 4066: 
 4067: "And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my
 4068: companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question
 4069: was already answered.
 4070: 
 4071: "Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It
 4072: is so. I know all about McCarthy."
 4073: 
 4074: The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried.
 4075: "But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you
 4076: my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at
 4077: the Assizes."
 4078: 
 4079: "I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.
 4080: 
 4081: "I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It
 4082: would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears
 4083: that I am arrested."
 4084: 
 4085: "It may not come to that," said Holmes.
 4086: 
 4087: "What?"
 4088: 
 4089: "I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter
 4090: who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.
 4091: Young McCarthy must be got off, however."
 4092: 
 4093: "I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for
 4094: years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a
 4095: month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."
 4096: 
 4097: Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand
 4098: and a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he
 4099: said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson
 4100: here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the
 4101: last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall
 4102: not use it unless it is absolutely needed."
 4103: 
 4104: "It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I
 4105: shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I
 4106: should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the
 4107: thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but
 4108: will not take me long to tell.
 4109: 
 4110: "You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil
 4111: incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of
 4112: such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,
 4113: and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be
 4114: in his power.
 4115: 
 4116: "It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap
 4117: then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at
 4118: anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck
 4119: with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you
 4120: would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and
 4121: we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time
 4122: to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.
 4123: Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party
 4124: is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.
 4125: 
 4126: "One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and
 4127: we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers
 4128: and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of
 4129: their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,
 4130: however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of
 4131: the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the
 4132: Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his
 4133: wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every
 4134: feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made
 4135: our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted
 4136: from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and
 4137: respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in
 4138: the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,
 4139: to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,
 4140: and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.
 4141: Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down
 4142: the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned
 4143: over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was
 4144: going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.
 4145: 
 4146: "I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in
 4147: Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his
 4148: foot.
 4149: 
 4150: "'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be
 4151: as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and
 4152: you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine,
 4153: law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman
 4154: within hail.'
 4155: 
 4156: "Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking
 4157: them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land
 4158: ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness;
 4159: turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my
 4160: elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more
 4161: afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he
 4162: wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without
 4163: question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing
 4164: which I could not give. He asked for Alice.
 4165: 
 4166: "His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was
 4167: known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that
 4168: his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was
 4169: firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that
 4170: I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that
 4171: was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do
 4172: his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses
 4173: to talk it over.
 4174: 
 4175: "When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I
 4176: smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.
 4177: But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in
 4178: me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my
 4179: daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she
 4180: were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I
 4181: and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a
 4182: man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and
 4183: a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb,
 4184: I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl!
 4185: Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I
 4186: did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,
 4187: I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl
 4188: should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
 4189: than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction
 4190: than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought
 4191: back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I
 4192: was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in
 4193: my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that
 4194: occurred."
 4195: 
 4196: "Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man
 4197: signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we
 4198: may never be exposed to such a temptation."
 4199: 
 4200: "I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"
 4201: 
 4202: "In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you
 4203: will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the
 4204: Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is
 4205: condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be
 4206: seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or
 4207: dead, shall be safe with us."
 4208: 
 4209: "Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds,
 4210: when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace
 4211: which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his
 4212: giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.
 4213: 
 4214: "God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate
 4215: play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such
 4216: a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say,
 4217: 'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.'"
 4218: 
 4219: James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a
 4220: number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and
 4221: submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven
 4222: months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is
 4223: every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily
 4224: together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their
 4225: past.
 4226: 
 4227: 
 4228: 
 4229: ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
 4230: 
 4231: When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes
 4232: cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which
 4233: present strange and interesting features that it is no easy
 4234: matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however,
 4235: have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have
 4236: not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend
 4237: possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of
 4238: these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his
 4239: analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without
 4240: an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and
 4241: have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and
 4242: surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
 4243: him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable
 4244: in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted
 4245: to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are
 4246: points in connection with it which never have been, and probably
 4247: never will be, entirely cleared up.
 4248: 
 4249: The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater
 4250: or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my
 4251: headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the
 4252: adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant
 4253: Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a
 4254: furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the
 4255: British barque "Sophy Anderson", of the singular adventures of the
 4256: Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the
 4257: Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered,
 4258: Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to
 4259: prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that
 4260: therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a
 4261: deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the
 4262: case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of
 4263: them present such singular features as the strange train of
 4264: circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.
 4265: 
 4266: It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales
 4267: had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had
 4268: screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that
 4269: even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced
 4270: to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and
 4271: to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which
 4272: shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like
 4273: untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew
 4274: higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in
 4275: the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the
 4276: fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the
 4277: other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until
 4278: the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text,
 4279: and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of
 4280: the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a
 4281: few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker
 4282: Street.
 4283: 
 4284: "Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the
 4285: bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"
 4286: 
 4287: "Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage
 4288: visitors."
 4289: 
 4290: "A client, then?"
 4291: 
 4292: "If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out
 4293: on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more
 4294: likely to be some crony of the landlady's."
 4295: 
 4296: Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there
 4297: came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He
 4298: stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and
 4299: towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
 4300: 
 4301: "Come in!" said he.
 4302: 
 4303: The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the
 4304: outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of
 4305: refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella
 4306: which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told
 4307: of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about
 4308: him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his
 4309: face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is
 4310: weighed down with some great anxiety.
 4311: 
 4312: "I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to
 4313: his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have
 4314: brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug
 4315: chamber."
 4316: 
 4317: "Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest
 4318: here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from
 4319: the south-west, I see."
 4320: 
 4321: "Yes, from Horsham."
 4322: 
 4323: "That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is
 4324: quite distinctive."
 4325: 
 4326: "I have come for advice."
 4327: 
 4328: "That is easily got."
 4329: 
 4330: "And help."
 4331: 
 4332: "That is not always so easy."
 4333: 
 4334: "I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast
 4335: how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal."
 4336: 
 4337: "Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."
 4338: 
 4339: "He said that you could solve anything."
 4340: 
 4341: "He said too much."
 4342: 
 4343: "That you are never beaten."
 4344: 
 4345: "I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a
 4346: woman."
 4347: 
 4348: "But what is that compared with the number of your successes?"
 4349: 
 4350: "It is true that I have been generally successful."
 4351: 
 4352: "Then you may be so with me."
 4353: 
 4354: "I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me
 4355: with some details as to your case."
 4356: 
 4357: "It is no ordinary one."
 4358: 
 4359: "None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of
 4360: appeal."
 4361: 
 4362: "And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you
 4363: have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of
 4364: events than those which have happened in my own family."
 4365: 
 4366: "You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the
 4367: essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards
 4368: question you as to those details which seem to me to be most
 4369: important."
 4370: 
 4371: The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out
 4372: towards the blaze.
 4373: 
 4374: "My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have,
 4375: as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful
 4376: business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an
 4377: idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the
 4378: affair.
 4379: 
 4380: "You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias
 4381: and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry,
 4382: which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He
 4383: was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business
 4384: met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire
 4385: upon a handsome competence.
 4386: 
 4387: "My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and
 4388: became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done
 4389: very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army,
 4390: and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When
 4391: Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where
 4392: he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came
 4393: back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham.
 4394: He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his
 4395: reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his
 4396: dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to
 4397: them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very
 4398: foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring
 4399: disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I
 4400: doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or
 4401: three fields round his house, and there he would take his
 4402: exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave
 4403: his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very
 4404: heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any
 4405: friends, not even his own brother.
 4406: 
 4407: "He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the
 4408: time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This
 4409: would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years
 4410: in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he
 4411: was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be
 4412: fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would
 4413: make me his representative both with the servants and with the
 4414: tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite
 4415: master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I
 4416: liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in
 4417: his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he
 4418: had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was
 4419: invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or
 4420: anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped
 4421: through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a
 4422: collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such
 4423: a room.
 4424: 
 4425: "One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp
 4426: lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a
 4427: common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all
 4428: paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From
 4429: India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can
 4430: this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little
 4431: dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to
 4432: laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight
 4433: of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his
 4434: skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he
 4435: still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and
 4436: then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'
 4437: 
 4438: "'What is it, uncle?' I cried.
 4439: 
 4440: "'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his
 4441: room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope
 4442: and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the
 4443: gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else
 4444: save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his
 4445: overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I
 4446: ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key,
 4447: which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small
 4448: brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
 4449: 
 4450: "'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,'
 4451: said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my
 4452: room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'
 4453: 
 4454: "I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to
 4455: step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the
 4456: grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned
 4457: paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I
 4458: glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was
 4459: printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the
 4460: envelope.
 4461: 
 4462: "'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave
 4463: my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to
 4464: my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to
 4465: you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you
 4466: cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest
 4467: enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't
 4468: say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper
 4469: where Mr. Fordham shows you.'
 4470: 
 4471: "I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with
 4472: him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest
 4473: impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every
 4474: way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I
 4475: could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left
 4476: behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed
 4477: and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I
 4478: could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever,
 4479: and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his
 4480: time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the
 4481: inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy
 4482: and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a
 4483: revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man,
 4484: and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by
 4485: man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would
 4486: rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him,
 4487: like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror
 4488: which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen
 4489: his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it
 4490: were new raised from a basin.
 4491: 
 4492: "Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to
 4493: abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those
 4494: drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when
 4495: we went to search for him, face downward in a little
 4496: green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There
 4497: was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep,
 4498: so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,
 4499: brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced
 4500: from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself
 4501: that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,
 4502: however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and
 4503: of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank."
 4504: 
 4505: "One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee,
 4506: one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me
 4507: have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and
 4508: the date of his supposed suicide."
 4509: 
 4510: "The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks
 4511: later, upon the night of May 2nd."
 4512: 
 4513: "Thank you. Pray proceed."
 4514: 
 4515: "When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my
 4516: request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been
 4517: always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its
 4518: contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a
 4519: paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and
 4520: 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath.
 4521: These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had
 4522: been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was
 4523: nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many
 4524: scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in
 4525: America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had
 4526: done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.
 4527: Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern
 4528: states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had
 4529: evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag
 4530: politicians who had been sent down from the North.
 4531: 
 4532: "Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at
 4533: Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the
 4534: January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my
 4535: father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the
 4536: breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened
 4537: envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the
 4538: outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what
 4539: he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked
 4540: very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
 4541: himself.
 4542: 
 4543: "'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.
 4544: 
 4545: "My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.
 4546: 
 4547: "He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are
 4548: the very letters. But what is this written above them?'
 4549: 
 4550: "'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his
 4551: shoulder.
 4552: 
 4553: "'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.
 4554: 
 4555: "'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the
 4556: papers must be those that are destroyed.'
 4557: 
 4558: "'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a
 4559: civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind.
 4560: Where does the thing come from?'
 4561: 
 4562: "'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.
 4563: 
 4564: "'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do
 4565: with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such
 4566: nonsense.'
 4567: 
 4568: "'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.
 4569: 
 4570: "'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'
 4571: 
 4572: "'Then let me do so?'
 4573: 
 4574: "'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such
 4575: nonsense.'
 4576: 
 4577: "It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate
 4578: man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of
 4579: forebodings.
 4580: 
 4581: "On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went
 4582: from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is
 4583: in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad
 4584: that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from
 4585: danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in
 4586: error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram
 4587: from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had
 4588: fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the
 4589: neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I
 4590: hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered
 4591: his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from
 4592: Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him,
 4593: and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in
 4594: bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.'
 4595: Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I
 4596: was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of
 4597: murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
 4598: robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.
 4599: And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease,
 4600: and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been
 4601: woven round him.
 4602: 
 4603: "In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me
 4604: why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well
 4605: convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an
 4606: incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as
 4607: pressing in one house as in another.
 4608: 
 4609: "It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two
 4610: years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time
 4611: I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that
 4612: this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended
 4613: with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon,
 4614: however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in
 4615: which it had come upon my father."
 4616: 
 4617: The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and
 4618: turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried
 4619: orange pips.
 4620: 
 4621: "This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is
 4622: London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were
 4623: upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the
 4624: papers on the sundial.'"
 4625: 
 4626: "What have you done?" asked Holmes.
 4627: 
 4628: "Nothing."
 4629: 
 4630: "Nothing?"
 4631: 
 4632: "To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white
 4633: hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor
 4634: rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in
 4635: the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight
 4636: and no precautions can guard against."
 4637: 
 4638: "Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are
 4639: lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for
 4640: despair."
 4641: 
 4642: "I have seen the police."
 4643: 
 4644: "Ah!"
 4645: 
 4646: "But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that
 4647: the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all
 4648: practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really
 4649: accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with
 4650: the warnings."
 4651: 
 4652: Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible
 4653: imbecility!" he cried.
 4654: 
 4655: "They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in
 4656: the house with me."
 4657: 
 4658: "Has he come with you to-night?"
 4659: 
 4660: "No. His orders were to stay in the house."
 4661: 
 4662: Again Holmes raved in the air.
 4663: 
 4664: "Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you
 4665: not come at once?"
 4666: 
 4667: "I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major
 4668: Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to
 4669: you."
 4670: 
 4671: "It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have
 4672: acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than
 4673: that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which
 4674: might help us?"
 4675: 
 4676: "There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat
 4677: pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted
 4678: paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance,"
 4679: said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I
 4680: observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the
 4681: ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet
 4682: upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it
 4683: may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from
 4684: among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond
 4685: the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think
 4686: myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is
 4687: undoubtedly my uncle's."
 4688: 
 4689: Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper,
 4690: which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from
 4691: a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the
 4692: following enigmatical notices:
 4693: 
 4694: "4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.
 4695: 
 4696: "7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and
 4697:       John Swain, of St. Augustine.
 4698: 
 4699: "9th. McCauley cleared.
 4700: 
 4701: "10th. John Swain cleared.
 4702: 
 4703: "12th. Visited Paramore. All well."
 4704: 
 4705: "Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it
 4706: to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another
 4707: instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told
 4708: me. You must get home instantly and act."
 4709: 
 4710: "What shall I do?"
 4711: 
 4712: "There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must
 4713: put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass
 4714: box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say
 4715: that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that
 4716: this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such
 4717: words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you
 4718: must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do
 4719: you understand?"
 4720: 
 4721: "Entirely."
 4722: 
 4723: "Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I
 4724: think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our
 4725: web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first
 4726: consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens
 4727: you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the
 4728: guilty parties."
 4729: 
 4730: "I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his
 4731: overcoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall
 4732: certainly do as you advise."
 4733: 
 4734: "Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in
 4735: the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that
 4736: you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you
 4737: go back?"
 4738: 
 4739: "By train from Waterloo."
 4740: 
 4741: "It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that
 4742: you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too
 4743: closely."
 4744: 
 4745: "I am armed."
 4746: 
 4747: "That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."
 4748: 
 4749: "I shall see you at Horsham, then?"
 4750: 
 4751: "No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek
 4752: it."
 4753: 
 4754: "Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news
 4755: as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every
 4756: particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside
 4757: the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered
 4758: against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come
 4759: to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet
 4760: of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them
 4761: once more.
 4762: 
 4763: Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk
 4764: forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he
 4765: lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue
 4766: smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.
 4767: 
 4768: "I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we
 4769: have had none more fantastic than this."
 4770: 
 4771: "Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."
 4772: 
 4773: "Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems
 4774: to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the
 4775: Sholtos."
 4776: 
 4777: "But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to
 4778: what these perils are?"
 4779: 
 4780: "There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.
 4781: 
 4782: "Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue
 4783: this unhappy family?"
 4784: 
 4785: Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the
 4786: arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal
 4787: reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a
 4788: single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the
 4789: chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which
 4790: would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole
 4791: animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who
 4792: has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents
 4793: should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both
 4794: before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the
 4795: reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study
 4796: which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the
 4797: aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest
 4798: pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to
 4799: utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this
 4800: in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all
 4801: knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and
 4802: encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so
 4803: impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge
 4804: which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have
 4805: endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one
 4806: occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits
 4807: in a very precise fashion."
 4808: 
 4809: "Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document.
 4810: Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I
 4811: remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the
 4812: mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry
 4813: eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime
 4814: records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and
 4815: self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the
 4816: main points of my analysis."
 4817: 
 4818: Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as
 4819: I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic
 4820: stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the
 4821: rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he
 4822: can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which
 4823: has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster
 4824: all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the
 4825: 'American Encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you.
 4826: Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be
 4827: deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong
 4828: presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for
 4829: leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their
 4830: habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for
 4831: the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love
 4832: of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of
 4833: someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis
 4834: that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from
 4835: America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by
 4836: considering the formidable letters which were received by himself
 4837: and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those
 4838: letters?"
 4839: 
 4840: "The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the
 4841: third from London."
 4842: 
 4843: "From East London. What do you deduce from that?"
 4844: 
 4845: "They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."
 4846: 
 4847: "Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that
 4848: the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was
 4849: on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the
 4850: case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and
 4851: its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.
 4852: Does that suggest anything?"
 4853: 
 4854: "A greater distance to travel."
 4855: 
 4856: "But the letter had also a greater distance to come."
 4857: 
 4858: "Then I do not see the point."
 4859: 
 4860: "There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man
 4861: or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send
 4862: their singular warning or token before them when starting upon
 4863: their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign
 4864: when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a
 4865: steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.
 4866: But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those
 4867: seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which
 4868: brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the
 4869: writer."
 4870: 
 4871: "It is possible."
 4872: 
 4873: "More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly
 4874: urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to
 4875: caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which
 4876: it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one
 4877: comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."
 4878: 
 4879: "Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless
 4880: persecution?"
 4881: 
 4882: "The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital
 4883: importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think
 4884: that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.
 4885: A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way
 4886: as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in
 4887: it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.
 4888: Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.
 4889: In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an
 4890: individual and becomes the badge of a society."
 4891: 
 4892: "But of what society?"
 4893: 
 4894: "Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and
 4895: sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"
 4896: 
 4897: "I never have."
 4898: 
 4899: Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it
 4900: is," said he presently:
 4901: 
 4902: "'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to
 4903: the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret
 4904: society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the
 4905: Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local
 4906: branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,
 4907: Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was
 4908: used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of
 4909: the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country
 4910: of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually
 4911: preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
 4912: but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some
 4913: parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this
 4914: the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might
 4915: fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would
 4916: unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and
 4917: unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the
 4918: society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a
 4919: case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with
 4920: impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the
 4921: perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite
 4922: of the efforts of the United States government and of the better
 4923: classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year
 4924: 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have
 4925: been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'
 4926: 
 4927: "You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that
 4928: the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the
 4929: disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may
 4930: well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his
 4931: family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.
 4932: You can understand that this register and diary may implicate
 4933: some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many
 4934: who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."
 4935: 
 4936: "Then the page we have seen--"
 4937: 
 4938: "Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent
 4939: the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to
 4940: them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or
 4941: left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a
 4942: sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let
 4943: some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only
 4944: chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have
 4945: told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done
 4946: to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for
 4947: half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable
 4948: ways of our fellow-men."
 4949: 
 4950: 
 4951: It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a
 4952: subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the
 4953: great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came
 4954: down.
 4955: 
 4956: "You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I
 4957: foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of
 4958: young Openshaw's."
 4959: 
 4960: "What steps will you take?" I asked.
 4961: 
 4962: "It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries.
 4963: I may have to go down to Horsham, after all."
 4964: 
 4965: "You will not go there first?"
 4966: 
 4967: "No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the
 4968: maid will bring up your coffee."
 4969: 
 4970: As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and
 4971: glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a
 4972: chill to my heart.
 4973: 
 4974: "Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."
 4975: 
 4976: "Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it
 4977: done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.
 4978: 
 4979: "My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy
 4980: Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:
 4981: 
 4982: "Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H
 4983: Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and
 4984: a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and
 4985: stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it
 4986: was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was
 4987: given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was
 4988: eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman
 4989: whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his
 4990: pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.
 4991: It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch
 4992: the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and
 4993: the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge
 4994: of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body
 4995: exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that
 4996: the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident,
 4997: which should have the effect of calling the attention of the
 4998: authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages."
 4999: 
 5000: We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and
 5001: shaken than I had ever seen him.
 5002: 
 5003: "That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty
 5004: feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal
 5005: matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my
 5006: hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that
 5007: I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chair
 5008: and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a
 5009: flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and
 5010: unclasping of his long thin hands.
 5011: 
 5012: "They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could
 5013: they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the
 5014: direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too
 5015: crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson,
 5016: we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"
 5017: 
 5018: "To the police?"
 5019: 
 5020: "No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may
 5021: take the flies, but not before."
 5022: 
 5023: All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in
 5024: the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes
 5025: had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he
 5026: entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard,
 5027: and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously,
 5028: washing it down with a long draught of water.
 5029: 
 5030: "You are hungry," I remarked.
 5031: 
 5032: "Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since
 5033: breakfast."
 5034: 
 5035: "Nothing?"
 5036: 
 5037: "Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."
 5038: 
 5039: "And how have you succeeded?"
 5040: 
 5041: "Well."
 5042: 
 5043: "You have a clue?"
 5044: 
 5045: "I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not
 5046: long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish
 5047: trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"
 5048: 
 5049: "What do you mean?"
 5050: 
 5051: He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he
 5052: squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and
 5053: thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote
 5054: "S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain
 5055: James Calhoun, Barque 'Lone Star,' Savannah, Georgia."
 5056: 
 5057: "That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling.
 5058: "It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a
 5059: precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."
 5060: 
 5061: "And who is this Captain Calhoun?"
 5062: 
 5063: "The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."
 5064: 
 5065: "How did you trace it, then?"
 5066: 
 5067: He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with
 5068: dates and names.
 5069: 
 5070: "I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers
 5071: and files of the old papers, following the future career of every
 5072: vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in
 5073: '83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were
 5074: reported there during those months. Of these, one, the 'Lone Star,'
 5075: instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported
 5076: as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to
 5077: one of the states of the Union."
 5078: 
 5079: "Texas, I think."
 5080: 
 5081: "I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must
 5082: have an American origin."
 5083: 
 5084: "What then?"
 5085: 
 5086: "I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque
 5087: 'Lone Star' was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a
 5088: certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present
 5089: in the port of London."
 5090: 
 5091: "Yes?"
 5092: 
 5093: "The 'Lone Star' had arrived here last week. I went down to the
 5094: Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by
 5095: the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired
 5096: to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and
 5097: as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the
 5098: Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."
 5099: 
 5100: "What will you do, then?"
 5101: 
 5102: "Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I
 5103: learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are
 5104: Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away
 5105: from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has
 5106: been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship
 5107: reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and
 5108: the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these
 5109: three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."
 5110: 
 5111: There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans,
 5112: and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the
 5113: orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as
 5114: resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very
 5115: severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for
 5116: news of the "Lone Star" of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We
 5117: did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a
 5118: shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough
 5119: of a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved upon it, and that is
 5120: all which we shall ever know of the fate of the "Lone Star."
 5121: 
 5122: 
 5123: 
 5124: ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
 5125: 
 5126: Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal
 5127: of the Theological College of St. George's, was much addicted to
 5128: opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some
 5129: foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De
 5130: Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had
 5131: drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the
 5132: same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the
 5133: practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many
 5134: years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of
 5135: mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see
 5136: him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point
 5137: pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble
 5138: man.
 5139: 
 5140: One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell,
 5141: about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the
 5142: clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work
 5143: down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.
 5144: 
 5145: "A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."
 5146: 
 5147: I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
 5148: 
 5149: We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps
 5150: upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in
 5151: some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.
 5152: 
 5153: "You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then,
 5154: suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms
 5155: about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in
 5156: such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."
 5157: 
 5158: "Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney.
 5159: How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when
 5160: you came in."
 5161: 
 5162: "I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was
 5163: always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds
 5164: to a light-house.
 5165: 
 5166: "It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine
 5167: and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or
 5168: should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"
 5169: 
 5170: "Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about
 5171: Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about
 5172: him!"
 5173: 
 5174: It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her
 5175: husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend
 5176: and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words
 5177: as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it
 5178: possible that we could bring him back to her?
 5179: 
 5180: It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late
 5181: he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the
 5182: farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been
 5183: confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and
 5184: shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him
 5185: eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the
 5186: dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the
 5187: effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar
 5188: of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could
 5189: she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and
 5190: pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
 5191: 
 5192: There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of
 5193: it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second
 5194: thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical
 5195: adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it
 5196: better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would
 5197: send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the
 5198: address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left
 5199: my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding
 5200: eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at
 5201: the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to
 5202: be.
 5203: 
 5204: But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my
 5205: adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the
 5206: high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east
 5207: of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached
 5208: by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the
 5209: mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.
 5210: Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in
 5211: the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the
 5212: light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch
 5213: and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the
 5214: brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
 5215: forecastle of an emigrant ship.
 5216: 
 5217: Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying
 5218: in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads
 5219: thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a
 5220: dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black
 5221: shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright,
 5222: now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of
 5223: the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to
 5224: themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,
 5225: monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then
 5226: suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own
 5227: thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At
 5228: the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside
 5229: which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old
 5230: man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon
 5231: his knees, staring into the fire.
 5232: 
 5233: As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe
 5234: for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
 5235: 
 5236: "Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend
 5237: of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."
 5238: 
 5239: There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and
 5240: peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and
 5241: unkempt, staring out at me.
 5242: 
 5243: "My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of
 5244: reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what
 5245: o'clock is it?"
 5246: 
 5247: "Nearly eleven."
 5248: 
 5249: "Of what day?"
 5250: 
 5251: "Of Friday, June 19th."
 5252: 
 5253: "Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What
 5254: d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his
 5255: arms and began to sob in a high treble key.
 5256: 
 5257: "I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting
 5258: this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
 5259: 
 5260: "So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here
 5261: a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll
 5262: go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate.
 5263: Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"
 5264: 
 5265: "Yes, I have one waiting."
 5266: 
 5267: "Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I
 5268: owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."
 5269: 
 5270: I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of
 5271: sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying
 5272: fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed
 5273: the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my
 5274: skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, and then look
 5275: back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I
 5276: glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my
 5277: side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very
 5278: wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between
 5279: his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his
 5280: fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my
 5281: self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
 5282: astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him
 5283: but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull
 5284: eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and
 5285: grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He
 5286: made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he
 5287: turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided
 5288: into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.
 5289: 
 5290: "Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"
 5291: 
 5292: "As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you
 5293: would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend
 5294: of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with
 5295: you."
 5296: 
 5297: "I have a cab outside."
 5298: 
 5299: "Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he
 5300: appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should
 5301: recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to
 5302: say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait
 5303: outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."
 5304: 
 5305: It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for
 5306: they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with
 5307: such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney
 5308: was once confined in the cab my mission was practically
 5309: accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better
 5310: than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular
 5311: adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a
 5312: few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him
 5313: out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a
 5314: very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den,
 5315: and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two
 5316: streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.
 5317: Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and
 5318: burst into a hearty fit of laughter.
 5319: 
 5320: "I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added
 5321: opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
 5322: weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical
 5323: views."
 5324: 
 5325: "I was certainly surprised to find you there."
 5326: 
 5327: "But not more so than I to find you."
 5328: 
 5329: "I came to find a friend."
 5330: 
 5331: "And I to find an enemy."
 5332: 
 5333: "An enemy?"
 5334: 
 5335: "Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural
 5336: prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable
 5337: inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent
 5338: ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been
 5339: recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an
 5340: hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own
 5341: purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have
 5342: vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that
 5343: building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some
 5344: strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless
 5345: nights."
 5346: 
 5347: "What! You do not mean bodies?"
 5348: 
 5349: "Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds
 5350: for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It
 5351: is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that
 5352: Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our
 5353: trap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his
 5354: teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a
 5355: similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle
 5356: of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.
 5357: 
 5358: "Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through
 5359: the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from
 5360: its side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"
 5361: 
 5362: "If I can be of use."
 5363: 
 5364: "Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still
 5365: more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."
 5366: 
 5367: "The Cedars?"
 5368: 
 5369: "Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I
 5370: conduct the inquiry."
 5371: 
 5372: "Where is it, then?"
 5373: 
 5374: "Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."
 5375: 
 5376: "But I am all in the dark."
 5377: 
 5378: "Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up
 5379: here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a
 5380: crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her
 5381: head. So long, then!"
 5382: 
 5383: He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through
 5384: the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which
 5385: widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad
 5386: balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly
 5387: beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and
 5388: mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of
 5389: the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of
 5390: revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a
 5391: star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of
 5392: the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his
 5393: breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat
 5394: beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which
 5395: seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in
 5396: upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles,
 5397: and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban
 5398: villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up
 5399: his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he
 5400: is acting for the best.
 5401: 
 5402: "You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes
 5403: you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great
 5404: thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are
 5405: not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear
 5406: little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."
 5407: 
 5408: "You forget that I know nothing about it."
 5409: 
 5410: "I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before
 5411: we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can
 5412: get nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I
 5413: can't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case
 5414: clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a
 5415: spark where all is dark to me."
 5416: 
 5417: "Proceed, then."
 5418: 
 5419: "Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee
 5420: a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have
 5421: plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very
 5422: nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made
 5423: friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter
 5424: of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no
 5425: occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into
 5426: town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon
 5427: Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of
 5428: age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very
 5429: affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know
 5430: him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far
 5431: as we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while
 5432: he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and
 5433: Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money
 5434: troubles have been weighing upon his mind.
 5435: 
 5436: "Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier
 5437: than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important
 5438: commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy
 5439: home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife
 5440: received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his
 5441: departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable
 5442: value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the
 5443: offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up
 5444: in your London, you will know that the office of the company is
 5445: in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where
 5446: you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for
 5447: the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office,
 5448: got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through
 5449: Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me
 5450: so far?"
 5451: 
 5452: "It is very clear."
 5453: 
 5454: "If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.
 5455: Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab,
 5456: as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself.
 5457: While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly
 5458: heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her
 5459: husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning
 5460: to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she
 5461: distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly
 5462: agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then
 5463: vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that
 5464: he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.
 5465: One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
 5466: although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town
 5467: in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.
 5468: 
 5469: "Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the
 5470: steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which
 5471: you found me to-night--and running through the front room she
 5472: attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At
 5473: the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of
 5474: whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who
 5475: acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled
 5476: with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the
 5477: lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of
 5478: constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The
 5479: inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the
 5480: continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to
 5481: the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no
 5482: sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was
 5483: no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,
 5484: it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly
 5485: swore that no one else had been in the front room during the
 5486: afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was
 5487: staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had
 5488: been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box
 5489: which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell
 5490: a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had
 5491: promised to bring home.
 5492: 
 5493: "This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple
 5494: showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.
 5495: The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an
 5496: abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a
 5497: sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon
 5498: the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom
 5499: window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered
 5500: at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The
 5501: bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On
 5502: examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill,
 5503: and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of
 5504: the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were
 5505: all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of
 5506: his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were
 5507: there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these
 5508: garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St.
 5509: Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no
 5510: other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon
 5511: the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by
 5512: swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of
 5513: the tragedy.
 5514: 
 5515: "And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately
 5516: implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the
 5517: vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was
 5518: known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few
 5519: seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could
 5520: hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence
 5521: was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no
 5522: knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he
 5523: could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
 5524: gentleman's clothes.
 5525: 
 5526: "So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who
 5527: lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was
 5528: certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.
 5529: Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which
 5530: is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a
 5531: professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police
 5532: regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some
 5533: little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand
 5534: side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the
 5535: wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,
 5536: cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he
 5537: is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the
 5538: greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I
 5539: have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of
 5540: making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised
 5541: at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His
 5542: appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him
 5543: without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face
 5544: disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has
 5545: turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a
 5546: pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular
 5547: contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid
 5548: the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he
 5549: is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be
 5550: thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now
 5551: learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been
 5552: the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."
 5553: 
 5554: "But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed
 5555: against a man in the prime of life?"
 5556: 
 5557: "He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in
 5558: other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.
 5559: Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that
 5560: weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional
 5561: strength in the others."
 5562: 
 5563: "Pray continue your narrative."
 5564: 
 5565: "Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the
 5566: window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her
 5567: presence could be of no help to them in their investigations.
 5568: Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful
 5569: examination of the premises, but without finding anything which
 5570: threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not
 5571: arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes
 5572: during which he might have communicated with his friend the
 5573: Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and
 5574: searched, without anything being found which could incriminate
 5575: him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right
 5576: shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been
 5577: cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from
 5578: there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and
 5579: that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from
 5580: the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr.
 5581: Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in
 5582: his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to
 5583: Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband
 5584: at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or
 5585: dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the
 5586: police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in
 5587: the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.
 5588: 
 5589: "And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they
 5590: had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not
 5591: Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And
 5592: what do you think they found in the pockets?"
 5593: 
 5594: "I cannot imagine."
 5595: 
 5596: "No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with
 5597: pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It
 5598: was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a
 5599: human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between
 5600: the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the
 5601: weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked
 5602: away into the river."
 5603: 
 5604: "But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the
 5605: room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"
 5606: 
 5607: "No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose
 5608: that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the
 5609: window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.
 5610: What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him
 5611: that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize
 5612: the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it
 5613: would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little
 5614: time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried
 5615: to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his
 5616: Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
 5617: There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret
 5618: hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he
 5619: stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the
 5620: pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and
 5621: would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard
 5622: the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the
 5623: window when the police appeared."
 5624: 
 5625: "It certainly sounds feasible."
 5626: 
 5627: "Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a
 5628: better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the
 5629: station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before
 5630: been anything against him. He had for years been known as a
 5631: professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very
 5632: quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and
 5633: the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was
 5634: doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is
 5635: he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are
 5636: all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot
 5637: recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
 5638: glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."
 5639: 
 5640: While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of
 5641: events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great
 5642: town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and
 5643: we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us.
 5644: Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered
 5645: villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.
 5646: 
 5647: "We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have
 5648: touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in
 5649: Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.
 5650: See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside
 5651: that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have
 5652: little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."
 5653: 
 5654: "But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I
 5655: asked.
 5656: 
 5657: "Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.
 5658: Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and
 5659: you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for
 5660: my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have
 5661: no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"
 5662: 
 5663: We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its
 5664: own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and
 5665: springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding
 5666: gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door
 5667: flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad
 5668: in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy
 5669: pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure
 5670: outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one
 5671: half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head
 5672: and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing
 5673: question.
 5674: 
 5675: "Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two
 5676: of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw
 5677: that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
 5678: 
 5679: "No good news?"
 5680: 
 5681: "None."
 5682: 
 5683: "No bad?"
 5684: 
 5685: "No."
 5686: 
 5687: "Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have
 5688: had a long day."
 5689: 
 5690: "This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to
 5691: me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it
 5692: possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this
 5693: investigation."
 5694: 
 5695: "I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly.
 5696: "You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our
 5697: arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so
 5698: suddenly upon us."
 5699: 
 5700: "My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were
 5701: not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of
 5702: any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be
 5703: indeed happy."
 5704: 
 5705: "Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entered a
 5706: well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had
 5707: been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two
 5708: plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain
 5709: answer."
 5710: 
 5711: "Certainly, madam."
 5712: 
 5713: "Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given
 5714: to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."
 5715: 
 5716: "Upon what point?"
 5717: 
 5718: "In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"
 5719: 
 5720: Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.
 5721: "Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking
 5722: keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
 5723: 
 5724: "Frankly, then, madam, I do not."
 5725: 
 5726: "You think that he is dead?"
 5727: 
 5728: "I do."
 5729: 
 5730: "Murdered?"
 5731: 
 5732: "I don't say that. Perhaps."
 5733: 
 5734: "And on what day did he meet his death?"
 5735: 
 5736: "On Monday."
 5737: 
 5738: "Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how
 5739: it is that I have received a letter from him to-day."
 5740: 
 5741: Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been
 5742: galvanised.
 5743: 
 5744: "What!" he roared.
 5745: 
 5746: "Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of
 5747: paper in the air.
 5748: 
 5749: "May I see it?"
 5750: 
 5751: "Certainly."
 5752: 
 5753: He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out
 5754: upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I
 5755: had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The
 5756: envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend
 5757: postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day
 5758: before, for it was considerably after midnight.
 5759: 
 5760: "Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your
 5761: husband's writing, madam."
 5762: 
 5763: "No, but the enclosure is."
 5764: 
 5765: "I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go
 5766: and inquire as to the address."
 5767: 
 5768: "How can you tell that?"
 5769: 
 5770: "The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried
 5771: itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that
 5772: blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight
 5773: off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This
 5774: man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before
 5775: he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not
 5776: familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is
 5777: nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!
 5778: there has been an enclosure here!"
 5779: 
 5780: "Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."
 5781: 
 5782: "And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"
 5783: 
 5784: "One of his hands."
 5785: 
 5786: "One?"
 5787: 
 5788: "His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual
 5789: writing, and yet I know it well."
 5790: 
 5791: "'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a
 5792: huge error which it may take some little time to rectify.
 5793: Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf
 5794: of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in
 5795: Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been
 5796: gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been
 5797: chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband's
 5798: hand, madam?"
 5799: 
 5800: "None. Neville wrote those words."
 5801: 
 5802: "And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair,
 5803: the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the
 5804: danger is over."
 5805: 
 5806: "But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."
 5807: 
 5808: "Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.
 5809: The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from
 5810: him."
 5811: 
 5812: "No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"
 5813: 
 5814: "Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only
 5815: posted to-day."
 5816: 
 5817: "That is possible."
 5818: 
 5819: "If so, much may have happened between."
 5820: 
 5821: "Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is
 5822: well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I
 5823: should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him
 5824: last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room
 5825: rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that
 5826: something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such
 5827: a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"
 5828: 
 5829: "I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman
 5830: may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical
 5831: reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong
 5832: piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband
 5833: is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away
 5834: from you?"
 5835: 
 5836: "I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."
 5837: 
 5838: "And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"
 5839: 
 5840: "No."
 5841: 
 5842: "And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"
 5843: 
 5844: "Very much so."
 5845: 
 5846: "Was the window open?"
 5847: 
 5848: "Yes."
 5849: 
 5850: "Then he might have called to you?"
 5851: 
 5852: "He might."
 5853: 
 5854: "He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"
 5855: 
 5856: "Yes."
 5857: 
 5858: "A call for help, you thought?"
 5859: 
 5860: "Yes. He waved his hands."
 5861: 
 5862: "But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the
 5863: unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"
 5864: 
 5865: "It is possible."
 5866: 
 5867: "And you thought he was pulled back?"
 5868: 
 5869: "He disappeared so suddenly."
 5870: 
 5871: "He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the
 5872: room?"
 5873: 
 5874: "No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and
 5875: the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs."
 5876: 
 5877: "Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his
 5878: ordinary clothes on?"
 5879: 
 5880: "But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare
 5881: throat."
 5882: 
 5883: "Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"
 5884: 
 5885: "Never."
 5886: 
 5887: "Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"
 5888: 
 5889: "Never."
 5890: 
 5891: "Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about
 5892: which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little
 5893: supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day
 5894: to-morrow."
 5895: 
 5896: A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our
 5897: disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary
 5898: after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however,
 5899: who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for
 5900: days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over,
 5901: rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view
 5902: until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his
 5903: data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now
 5904: preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and
 5905: waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered
 5906: about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from
 5907: the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of
 5908: Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with
 5909: an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front
 5910: of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an
 5911: old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the
 5912: corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him,
 5913: silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set
 5914: aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he
 5915: sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found
 5916: the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still
 5917: between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was
 5918: full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of
 5919: shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
 5920: 
 5921: "Awake, Watson?" he asked.
 5922: 
 5923: "Yes."
 5924: 
 5925: "Game for a morning drive?"
 5926: 
 5927: "Certainly."
 5928: 
 5929: "Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the
 5930: stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He
 5931: chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed
 5932: a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
 5933: 
 5934: As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one
 5935: was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly
 5936: finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was
 5937: putting in the horse.
 5938: 
 5939: "I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his
 5940: boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the
 5941: presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve
 5942: to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the
 5943: key of the affair now."
 5944: 
 5945: "And where is it?" I asked, smiling.
 5946: 
 5947: "In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he
 5948: continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been
 5949: there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this
 5950: Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will
 5951: not fit the lock."
 5952: 
 5953: We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into
 5954: the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and
 5955: trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both
 5956: sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country
 5957: carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but
 5958: the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as
 5959: some city in a dream.
 5960: 
 5961: "It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes,
 5962: flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been
 5963: as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than
 5964: never to learn it at all."
 5965: 
 5966: In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily
 5967: from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey
 5968: side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the
 5969: river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the
 5970: right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well
 5971: known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted
 5972: him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.
 5973: 
 5974: "Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.
 5975: 
 5976: "Inspector Bradstreet, sir."
 5977: 
 5978: "Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come
 5979: down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged
 5980: jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet."
 5981: "Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small,
 5982: office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a
 5983: telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his
 5984: desk.
 5985: 
 5986: "What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"
 5987: 
 5988: "I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged
 5989: with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St.
 5990: Clair, of Lee."
 5991: 
 5992: "Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."
 5993: 
 5994: "So I heard. You have him here?"
 5995: 
 5996: "In the cells."
 5997: 
 5998: "Is he quiet?"
 5999: 
 6000: "Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."
 6001: 
 6002: "Dirty?"
 6003: 
 6004: "Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his
 6005: face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been
 6006: settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you
 6007: saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."
 6008: 
 6009: "I should like to see him very much."
 6010: 
 6011: "Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave
 6012: your bag."
 6013: 
 6014: "No, I think that I'll take it."
 6015: 
 6016: "Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a
 6017: passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and
 6018: brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each
 6019: side.
 6020: 
 6021: "The third on the right is his," said the inspector. "Here it
 6022: is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door
 6023: and glanced through.
 6024: 
 6025: "He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."
 6026: 
 6027: We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his
 6028: face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and
 6029: heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his
 6030: calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his
 6031: tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely
 6032: dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its
 6033: repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right
 6034: across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up
 6035: one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a
 6036: perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over
 6037: his eyes and forehead.
 6038: 
 6039: "He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.
 6040: 
 6041: "He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that
 6042: he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me."
 6043: He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my
 6044: astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.
 6045: 
 6046: "He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.
 6047: 
 6048: "Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
 6049: quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable
 6050: figure."
 6051: 
 6052: "Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't
 6053: look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his
 6054: key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The
 6055: sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep
 6056: slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge,
 6057: and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the
 6058: prisoner's face.
 6059: 
 6060: "Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of
 6061: Lee, in the county of Kent."
 6062: 
 6063: Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled
 6064: off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the
 6065: coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had
 6066: seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the
 6067: repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled
 6068: red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale,
 6069: sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned,
 6070: rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.
 6071: Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and
 6072: threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
 6073: 
 6074: "Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing
 6075: man. I know him from the photograph."
 6076: 
 6077: The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons
 6078: himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I
 6079: charged with?"
 6080: 
 6081: "With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be
 6082: charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of
 6083: it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been
 6084: twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."
 6085: 
 6086: "If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime
 6087: has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally
 6088: detained."
 6089: 
 6090: "No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said
 6091: Holmes. "You would have done better to have trusted your wife."
 6092: 
 6093: "It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner.
 6094: "God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My
 6095: God! What an exposure! What can I do?"
 6096: 
 6097: Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him
 6098: kindly on the shoulder.
 6099: 
 6100: "If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said
 6101: he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand,
 6102: if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible
 6103: case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the
 6104: details should find their way into the papers. Inspector
 6105: Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you
 6106: might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case
 6107: would then never go into court at all."
 6108: 
 6109: "God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have
 6110: endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left
 6111: my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.
 6112: 
 6113: "You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a
 6114: schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent
 6115: education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and
 6116: finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day
 6117: my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the
 6118: metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point
 6119: from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying
 6120: begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to
 6121: base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the
 6122: secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for
 6123: my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my
 6124: face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good
 6125: scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a
 6126: small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of
 6127: hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business
 6128: part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a
 6129: beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned
 6130: home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no
 6131: less than 26s. 4d.
 6132: 
 6133: "I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until,
 6134: some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ
 6135: served upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit's end where to get
 6136: the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's
 6137: grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,
 6138: and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In
 6139: ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.
 6140: 
 6141: "Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous
 6142: work at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in
 6143: a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on
 6144: the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my
 6145: pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up
 6146: reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first
 6147: chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets
 6148: with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a
 6149: low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could
 6150: every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings
 6151: transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow,
 6152: a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that
 6153: my secret was safe in his possession.
 6154: 
 6155: "Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of
 6156: money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London
 6157: could earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average
 6158: takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making
 6159: up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by
 6160: practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City.
 6161: All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,
 6162: and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.
 6163: 
 6164: "As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the
 6165: country, and eventually married, without anyone having a
 6166: suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had
 6167: business in the City. She little knew what.
 6168: 
 6169: "Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my
 6170: room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw,
 6171: to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the
 6172: street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of
 6173: surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my
 6174: confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from
 6175: coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that
 6176: she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on
 6177: those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's
 6178: eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it
 6179: occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that
 6180: the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening
 6181: by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in
 6182: the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was
 6183: weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from
 6184: the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of
 6185: the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes
 6186: would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of
 6187: constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,
 6188: I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.
 6189: Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.
 6190: 
 6191: "I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I
 6192: was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and
 6193: hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would
 6194: be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the
 6195: Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together
 6196: with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to
 6197: fear."
 6198: 
 6199: "That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.
 6200: 
 6201: "Good God! What a week she must have spent!"
 6202: 
 6203: "The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet,
 6204: "and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to
 6205: post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor
 6206: customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."
 6207: 
 6208: "That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt
 6209: of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"
 6210: 
 6211: "Many times; but what was a fine to me?"
 6212: 
 6213: "It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are
 6214: to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."
 6215: 
 6216: "I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."
 6217: 
 6218: "In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps
 6219: may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out.
 6220: I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for
 6221: having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your
 6222: results."
 6223: 
 6224: "I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five
 6225: pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if
 6226: we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."
 6227: 
 6228: 
 6229: 
 6230: VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
 6231: 
 6232: I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second
 6233: morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the
 6234: compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a
 6235: purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the
 6236: right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly
 6237: studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and
 6238: on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable
 6239: hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several
 6240: places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
 6241: suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
 6242: purpose of examination.
 6243: 
 6244: "You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."
 6245: 
 6246: "Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss
 6247: my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his
 6248: thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in
 6249: connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and
 6250: even of instruction."
 6251: 
 6252: I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
 6253: crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows
 6254: were thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that,
 6255: homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to
 6256: it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of
 6257: some mystery and the punishment of some crime."
 6258: 
 6259: "No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of
 6260: those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have
 6261: four million human beings all jostling each other within the
 6262: space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so
 6263: dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events
 6264: may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be
 6265: presented which may be striking and bizarre without being
 6266: criminal. We have already had experience of such."
 6267: 
 6268: "So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I
 6269: have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any
 6270: legal crime."
 6271: 
 6272: "Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler
 6273: papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the
 6274: adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt
 6275: that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.
 6276: You know Peterson, the commissionaire?"
 6277: 
 6278: "Yes."
 6279: 
 6280: "It is to him that this trophy belongs."
 6281: 
 6282: "It is his hat."
 6283: 
 6284: "No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will
 6285: look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual
 6286: problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon
 6287: Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I
 6288: have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's
 6289: fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas
 6290: morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was
 6291: returning from some small jollification and was making his way
 6292: homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in
 6293: the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and
 6294: carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the
 6295: corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger
 6296: and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the
 6297: man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and,
 6298: swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.
 6299: Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his
 6300: assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and
 6301: seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him,
 6302: dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the
 6303: labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham
 6304: Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of
 6305: Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of
 6306: battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this
 6307: battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."
 6308: 
 6309: "Which surely he restored to their owner?"
 6310: 
 6311: "My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For
 6312: Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to
 6313: the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H.
 6314: B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are
 6315: some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in
 6316: this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any
 6317: one of them."
 6318: 
 6319: "What, then, did Peterson do?"
 6320: 
 6321: "He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,
 6322: knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.
 6323: The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs
 6324: that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it
 6325: should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried
 6326: it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose,
 6327: while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who
 6328: lost his Christmas dinner."
 6329: 
 6330: "Did he not advertise?"
 6331: 
 6332: "No."
 6333: 
 6334: "Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"
 6335: 
 6336: "Only as much as we can deduce."
 6337: 
 6338: "From his hat?"
 6339: 
 6340: "Precisely."
 6341: 
 6342: "But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered
 6343: felt?"
 6344: 
 6345: "Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather
 6346: yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this
 6347: article?"
 6348: 
 6349: I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
 6350: ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round
 6351: shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of
 6352: red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's
 6353: name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were
 6354: scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a
 6355: hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was
 6356: cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places,
 6357: although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
 6358: discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.
 6359: 
 6360: "I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.
 6361: 
 6362: "On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail,
 6363: however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in
 6364: drawing your inferences."
 6365: 
 6366: "Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"
 6367: 
 6368: He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective
 6369: fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less
 6370: suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there
 6371: are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others
 6372: which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That
 6373: the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the
 6374: face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the
 6375: last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He
 6376: had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a
 6377: moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his
 6378: fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,
 6379: at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that
 6380: his wife has ceased to love him."
 6381: 
 6382: "My dear Holmes!"
 6383: 
 6384: "He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he
 6385: continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a
 6386: sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is
 6387: middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the
 6388: last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are
 6389: the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also,
 6390: by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid
 6391: on in his house."
 6392: 
 6393: "You are certainly joking, Holmes."
 6394: 
 6395: "Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you
 6396: these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"
 6397: 
 6398: "I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I
 6399: am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that
 6400: this man was intellectual?"
 6401: 
 6402: For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right
 6403: over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is
 6404: a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a
 6405: brain must have something in it."
 6406: 
 6407: "The decline of his fortunes, then?"
 6408: 
 6409: "This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge
 6410: came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the
 6411: band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could
 6412: afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no
 6413: hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."
 6414: 
 6415: "Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the
 6416: foresight and the moral retrogression?"
 6417: 
 6418: Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting
 6419: his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.
 6420: "They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a
 6421: sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his
 6422: way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see
 6423: that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace
 6424: it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly,
 6425: which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other
 6426: hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the
 6427: felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not
 6428: entirely lost his self-respect."
 6429: 
 6430: "Your reasoning is certainly plausible."
 6431: 
 6432: "The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is
 6433: grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses
 6434: lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the
 6435: lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of
 6436: hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all
 6437: appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of
 6438: lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey
 6439: dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,
 6440: showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while
 6441: the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the
 6442: wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in
 6443: the best of training."
 6444: 
 6445: "But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."
 6446: 
 6447: "This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear
 6448: Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and
 6449: when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear
 6450: that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's
 6451: affection."
 6452: 
 6453: "But he might be a bachelor."
 6454: 
 6455: "Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his
 6456: wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."
 6457: 
 6458: "You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce
 6459: that the gas is not laid on in his house?"
 6460: 
 6461: "One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I
 6462: see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt
 6463: that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with
 6464: burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in
 6465: one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never
 6466: got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"
 6467: 
 6468: "Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as
 6469: you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm
 6470: done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a
 6471: waste of energy."
 6472: 
 6473: Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew
 6474: open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment
 6475: with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with
 6476: astonishment.
 6477: 
 6478: "The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.
 6479: 
 6480: "Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off
 6481: through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon
 6482: the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.
 6483: 
 6484: "See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out
 6485: his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
 6486: scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but
 6487: of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric
 6488: point in the dark hollow of his hand.
 6489: 
 6490: Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said
 6491: he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you
 6492: have got?"
 6493: 
 6494: "A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though
 6495: it were putty."
 6496: 
 6497: "It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone."
 6498: 
 6499: "Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.
 6500: 
 6501: "Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I
 6502: have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day
 6503: lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be
 6504: conjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly
 6505: not within a twentieth part of the market price."
 6506: 
 6507: "A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire
 6508: plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.
 6509: 
 6510: "That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are
 6511: sentimental considerations in the background which would induce
 6512: the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but
 6513: recover the gem."
 6514: 
 6515: "It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I
 6516: remarked.
 6517: 
 6518: "Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner,
 6519: a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's
 6520: jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case
 6521: has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the
 6522: matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers,
 6523: glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out,
 6524: doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:
 6525: 
 6526: "Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was
 6527: brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst.,
 6528: abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the
 6529: valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder,
 6530: upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect
 6531: that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess
 6532: of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might
 6533: solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had
 6534: remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been
 6535: called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared,
 6536: that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco
 6537: casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was
 6538: accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the
 6539: dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was
 6540: arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found
 6541: either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to
 6542: the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on
 6543: discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,
 6544: where she found matters as described by the last witness.
 6545: Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest
 6546: of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence
 6547: in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for
 6548: robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate
 6549: refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to
 6550: the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion
 6551: during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was
 6552: carried out of court."
 6553: 
 6554: "Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully,
 6555: tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the
 6556: sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to
 6557: the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You
 6558: see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much
 6559: more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the
 6560: stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry
 6561: Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other
 6562: characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set
 6563: ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and
 6564: ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To
 6565: do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie
 6566: undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If
 6567: this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods."
 6568: 
 6569: "What will you say?"
 6570: 
 6571: "Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at
 6572: the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.
 6573: Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at
 6574: 221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."
 6575: 
 6576: "Very. But will he see it?"
 6577: 
 6578: "Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor
 6579: man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his
 6580: mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson
 6581: that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must
 6582: have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his
 6583: bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to
 6584: see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to
 6585: it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency
 6586: and have this put in the evening papers."
 6587: 
 6588: "In which, sir?"
 6589: 
 6590: "Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News,
 6591: Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."
 6592: 
 6593: "Very well, sir. And this stone?"
 6594: 
 6595: "Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,
 6596: Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here
 6597: with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place
 6598: of the one which your family is now devouring."
 6599: 
 6600: When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and
 6601: held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just
 6602: see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and
 6603: focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet
 6604: baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a
 6605: bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found
 6606: in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable
 6607: in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is
 6608: blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has
 6609: already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a
 6610: vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about
 6611: for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.
 6612: Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the
 6613: gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and
 6614: drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."
 6615: 
 6616: "Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"
 6617: 
 6618: "I cannot tell."
 6619: 
 6620: "Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had
 6621: anything to do with the matter?"
 6622: 
 6623: "It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an
 6624: absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he
 6625: was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made
 6626: of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple
 6627: test if we have an answer to our advertisement."
 6628: 
 6629: "And you can do nothing until then?"
 6630: 
 6631: "Nothing."
 6632: 
 6633: "In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall
 6634: come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I
 6635: should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."
 6636: 
 6637: "Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I
 6638: believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I
 6639: ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."
 6640: 
 6641: I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past
 6642: six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I
 6643: approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a
 6644: coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the
 6645: bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I
 6646: arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to
 6647: Holmes' room.
 6648: 
 6649: "Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair
 6650: and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he
 6651: could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.
 6652: Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is
 6653: more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have
 6654: just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"
 6655: 
 6656: "Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."
 6657: 
 6658: He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a
 6659: broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of
 6660: grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight
 6661: tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his
 6662: habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in
 6663: front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded
 6664: from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a
 6665: slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the
 6666: impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had
 6667: ill-usage at the hands of fortune.
 6668: 
 6669: "We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes,
 6670: "because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your
 6671: address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."
 6672: 
 6673: Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not
 6674: been so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "I had
 6675: no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off
 6676: both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a
 6677: hopeless attempt at recovering them."
 6678: 
 6679: "Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to
 6680: eat it."
 6681: 
 6682: "To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his
 6683: excitement.
 6684: 
 6685: "Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.
 6686: But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is
 6687: about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your
 6688: purpose equally well?"
 6689: 
 6690: "Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of
 6691: relief.
 6692: 
 6693: "Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of
 6694: your own bird, so if you wish--"
 6695: 
 6696: The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as
 6697: relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly
 6698: see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are
 6699: going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I
 6700: will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive
 6701: upon the sideboard."
 6702: 
 6703: Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug
 6704: of his shoulders.
 6705: 
 6706: "There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the
 6707: way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one
 6708: from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a
 6709: better grown goose."
 6710: 
 6711: "Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly
 6712: gained property under his arm. "There are a few of us who
 6713: frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in
 6714: the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our
 6715: good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which,
 6716: on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to
 6717: receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the
 6718: rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a
 6719: Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With
 6720: a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
 6721: strode off upon his way.
 6722: 
 6723: "So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the
 6724: door behind him. "It is quite certain that he knows nothing
 6725: whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"
 6726: 
 6727: "Not particularly."
 6728: 
 6729: "Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow
 6730: up this clue while it is still hot."
 6731: 
 6732: "By all means."
 6733: 
 6734: It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped
 6735: cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly
 6736: in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out
 6737: into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out
 6738: crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter,
 6739: Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into
 6740: Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at
 6741: the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one
 6742: of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open
 6743: the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from
 6744: the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.
 6745: 
 6746: "Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,"
 6747: said he.
 6748: 
 6749: "My geese!" The man seemed surprised.
 6750: 
 6751: "Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker,
 6752: who was a member of your goose club."
 6753: 
 6754: "Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."
 6755: 
 6756: "Indeed! Whose, then?"
 6757: 
 6758: "Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden."
 6759: 
 6760: "Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"
 6761: 
 6762: "Breckinridge is his name."
 6763: 
 6764: "Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord,
 6765: and prosperity to your house. Good-night."
 6766: 
 6767: "Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat
 6768: as we came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though
 6769: we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we
 6770: have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal
 6771: servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible
 6772: that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we
 6773: have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police,
 6774: and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us
 6775: follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and
 6776: quick march!"
 6777: 
 6778: We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a
 6779: zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest
 6780: stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor
 6781: a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was
 6782: helping a boy to put up the shutters.
 6783: 
 6784: "Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.
 6785: 
 6786: The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my
 6787: companion.
 6788: 
 6789: "Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the
 6790: bare slabs of marble.
 6791: 
 6792: "Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."
 6793: 
 6794: "That's no good."
 6795: 
 6796: "Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."
 6797: 
 6798: "Ah, but I was recommended to you."
 6799: 
 6800: "Who by?"
 6801: 
 6802: "The landlord of the Alpha."
 6803: 
 6804: "Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."
 6805: 
 6806: "Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"
 6807: 
 6808: To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the
 6809: salesman.
 6810: 
 6811: "Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms
 6812: akimbo, "what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now."
 6813: 
 6814: "It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the
 6815: geese which you supplied to the Alpha."
 6816: 
 6817: "Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"
 6818: 
 6819: "Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you
 6820: should be so warm over such a trifle."
 6821: 
 6822: "Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.
 6823: When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end
 6824: of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you
 6825: sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One
 6826: would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the
 6827: fuss that is made over them."
 6828: 
 6829: "Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been
 6830: making inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us
 6831: the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my
 6832: opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the
 6833: bird I ate is country bred."
 6834: 
 6835: "Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped
 6836: the salesman.
 6837: 
 6838: "It's nothing of the kind."
 6839: 
 6840: "I say it is."
 6841: 
 6842: "I don't believe it."
 6843: 
 6844: "D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled
 6845: them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that
 6846: went to the Alpha were town bred."
 6847: 
 6848: "You'll never persuade me to believe that."
 6849: 
 6850: "Will you bet, then?"
 6851: 
 6852: "It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But
 6853: I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be
 6854: obstinate."
 6855: 
 6856: The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said
 6857: he.
 6858: 
 6859: The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
 6860: greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging
 6861: lamp.
 6862: 
 6863: "Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I
 6864: was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is
 6865: still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"
 6866: 
 6867: "Well?"
 6868: 
 6869: "That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well,
 6870: then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers
 6871: after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.
 6872: Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a
 6873: list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just
 6874: read it out to me."
 6875: 
 6876: "Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.
 6877: 
 6878: "Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."
 6879: 
 6880: Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs.
 6881: Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.'"
 6882: 
 6883: "Now, then, what's the last entry?"
 6884: 
 6885: "'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.'"
 6886: 
 6887: "Quite so. There you are. And underneath?"
 6888: 
 6889: "'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.'"
 6890: 
 6891: "What have you to say now?"
 6892: 
 6893: Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from
 6894: his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the
 6895: air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off
 6896: he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless
 6897: fashion which was peculiar to him.
 6898: 
 6899: "When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un'
 6900: protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,"
 6901: said he. "I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of
 6902: him, that man would not have given me such complete information
 6903: as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a
 6904: wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our
 6905: quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is
 6906: whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or
 6907: whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what
 6908: that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves
 6909: who are anxious about the matter, and I should--"
 6910: 
 6911: His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke
 6912: out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a
 6913: little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of
 6914: yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while
 6915: Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was
 6916: shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.
 6917: 
 6918: "I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you
 6919: were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more
 6920: with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.
 6921: Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with
 6922: it? Did I buy the geese off you?"
 6923: 
 6924: "No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little
 6925: man.
 6926: 
 6927: "Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."
 6928: 
 6929: "She told me to ask you."
 6930: 
 6931: "Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had
 6932: enough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and
 6933: the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.
 6934: 
 6935: "Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes.
 6936: "Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this
 6937: fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who
 6938: lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook
 6939: the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang
 6940: round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of
 6941: colour had been driven from his face.
 6942: 
 6943: "Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering
 6944: voice.
 6945: 
 6946: "You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help
 6947: overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.
 6948: I think that I could be of assistance to you."
 6949: 
 6950: "You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"
 6951: 
 6952: "My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other
 6953: people don't know."
 6954: 
 6955: "But you can know nothing of this?"
 6956: 
 6957: "Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to
 6958: trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton
 6959: Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.
 6960: Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.
 6961: Henry Baker is a member."
 6962: 
 6963: "Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried
 6964: the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.
 6965: "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."
 6966: 
 6967: Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that
 6968: case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this
 6969: wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we
 6970: go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."
 6971: 
 6972: The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he
 6973: answered with a sidelong glance.
 6974: 
 6975: "No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always
 6976: awkward doing business with an alias."
 6977: 
 6978: A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then,"
 6979: said he, "my real name is James Ryder."
 6980: 
 6981: "Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray
 6982: step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you
 6983: everything which you would wish to know."
 6984: 
 6985: The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
 6986: half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure
 6987: whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.
 6988: Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in
 6989: the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during
 6990: our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and
 6991: the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous
 6992: tension within him.
 6993: 
 6994: "Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.
 6995: "The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold,
 6996: Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my
 6997: slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then!
 6998: You want to know what became of those geese?"
 6999: 
 7000: "Yes, sir."
 7001: 
 7002: "Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in
 7003: which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the
 7004: tail."
 7005: 
 7006: Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell
 7007: me where it went to?"
 7008: 
 7009: "It came here."
 7010: 
 7011: "Here?"
 7012: 
 7013: "Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that
 7014: you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was
 7015: dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.
 7016: I have it here in my museum."
 7017: 
 7018: Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece
 7019: with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up
 7020: the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,
 7021: brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a
 7022: drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.
 7023: 
 7024: "The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or
 7025: you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,
 7026: Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with
 7027: impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little
 7028: more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"
 7029: 
 7030: For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy
 7031: brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring
 7032: with frightened eyes at his accuser.
 7033: 
 7034: "I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I
 7035: could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.
 7036: Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case
 7037: complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the
 7038: Countess of Morcar's?"
 7039: 
 7040: "It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a
 7041: crackling voice.
 7042: 
 7043: "I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of
 7044: sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has
 7045: been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous
 7046: in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the
 7047: making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man
 7048: Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter
 7049: before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.
 7050: What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's
 7051: room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he
 7052: should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled
 7053: the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man
 7054: arrested. You then--"
 7055: 
 7056: Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
 7057: companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked.
 7058: "Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I
 7059: never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll
 7060: swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's
 7061: sake, don't!"
 7062: 
 7063: "Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well
 7064: to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this
 7065: poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."
 7066: 
 7067: "I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the
 7068: charge against him will break down."
 7069: 
 7070: "Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account
 7071: of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came
 7072: the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies
 7073: your only hope of safety."
 7074: 
 7075: Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you
 7076: it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been
 7077: arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get
 7078: away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment
 7079: the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my
 7080: room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.
 7081: I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's
 7082: house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton
 7083: Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there
 7084: every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective;
 7085: and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down
 7086: my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me
 7087: what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I
 7088: had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went
 7089: into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would
 7090: be best to do.
 7091: 
 7092: "I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and
 7093: has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met
 7094: me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they
 7095: could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to
 7096: me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind
 7097: to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my
 7098: confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money.
 7099: But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had
 7100: gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be
 7101: seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat
 7102: pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at
 7103: the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly
 7104: an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the
 7105: best detective that ever lived.
 7106: 
 7107: "My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the
 7108: pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she
 7109: was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in
 7110: it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in
 7111: the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big
 7112: one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill
 7113: open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger
 7114: could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass
 7115: along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped
 7116: and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the
 7117: matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and
 7118: fluttered off among the others.
 7119: 
 7120: "'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.
 7121: 
 7122: "'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I
 7123: was feeling which was the fattest.'
 7124: 
 7125: "'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we
 7126: call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six
 7127: of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen
 7128: for the market.'
 7129: 
 7130: "'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you,
 7131: I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'
 7132: 
 7133: "'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we
 7134: fattened it expressly for you.'
 7135: 
 7136: "'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.
 7137: 
 7138: "'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it
 7139: you want, then?'
 7140: 
 7141: "'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the
 7142: flock.'
 7143: 
 7144: "'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'
 7145: 
 7146: "Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird
 7147: all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was
 7148: a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed
 7149: until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My
 7150: heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I
 7151: knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,
 7152: rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There
 7153: was not a bird to be seen there.
 7154: 
 7155: "'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.
 7156: 
 7157: "'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'
 7158: 
 7159: "'Which dealer's?'
 7160: 
 7161: "'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'
 7162: 
 7163: "'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same
 7164: as the one I chose?'
 7165: 
 7166: "'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never
 7167: tell them apart.'
 7168: 
 7169: "Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my
 7170: feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the
 7171: lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they
 7172: had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always
 7173: answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.
 7174: Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself
 7175: a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which
 7176: I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into
 7177: convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.
 7178: 
 7179: There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and
 7180: by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the
 7181: edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.
 7182: 
 7183: "Get out!" said he.
 7184: 
 7185: "What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"
 7186: 
 7187: "No more words. Get out!"
 7188: 
 7189: And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon
 7190: the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running
 7191: footfalls from the street.
 7192: 
 7193: "After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his
 7194: clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their
 7195: deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing;
 7196: but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must
 7197: collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just
 7198: possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong
 7199: again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and
 7200: you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of
 7201: forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and
 7202: whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you
 7203: will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin
 7204: another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief
 7205: feature."
 7206: 
 7207: 
 7208: 
 7209: VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
 7210: 
 7211: On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I
 7212: have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend
 7213: Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number
 7214: merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did
 7215: rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of
 7216: wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation
 7217: which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.
 7218: Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which
 7219: presented more singular features than that which was associated
 7220: with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.
 7221: The events in question occurred in the early days of my
 7222: association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors
 7223: in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them
 7224: upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the
 7225: time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by
 7226: the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It
 7227: is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I
 7228: have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the
 7229: death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even
 7230: more terrible than the truth.
 7231: 
 7232: It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to
 7233: find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my
 7234: bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the
 7235: mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I
 7236: blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little
 7237: resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.
 7238: 
 7239: "Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the
 7240: common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she
 7241: retorted upon me, and I on you."
 7242: 
 7243: "What is it, then--a fire?"
 7244: 
 7245: "No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a
 7246: considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She
 7247: is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander
 7248: about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock
 7249: sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is
 7250: something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it
 7251: prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to
 7252: follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should
 7253: call you and give you the chance."
 7254: 
 7255: "My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."
 7256: 
 7257: I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his
 7258: professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid
 7259: deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a
 7260: logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were
 7261: submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in
 7262: a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A
 7263: lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in
 7264: the window, rose as we entered.
 7265: 
 7266: "Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock
 7267: Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson,
 7268: before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am
 7269: glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the
 7270: fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot
 7271: coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."
 7272: 
 7273: "It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low
 7274: voice, changing her seat as requested.
 7275: 
 7276: "What, then?"
 7277: 
 7278: "It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as
 7279: she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable
 7280: state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless
 7281: frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features
 7282: and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot
 7283: with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.
 7284: Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,
 7285: all-comprehensive glances.
 7286: 
 7287: "You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and
 7288: patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no
 7289: doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."
 7290: 
 7291: "You know me, then?"
 7292: 
 7293: "No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm
 7294: of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had
 7295: a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached
 7296: the station."
 7297: 
 7298: The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my
 7299: companion.
 7300: 
 7301: "There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left
 7302: arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven
 7303: places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a
 7304: dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you
 7305: sit on the left-hand side of the driver."
 7306: 
 7307: "Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said
 7308: she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at
 7309: twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I
 7310: can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.
 7311: I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me,
 7312: and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,
 7313: Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you
 7314: helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had
 7315: your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me,
 7316: too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness
 7317: which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward
 7318: you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be
 7319: married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you
 7320: shall not find me ungrateful."
 7321: 
 7322: Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small
 7323: case-book, which he consulted.
 7324: 
 7325: "Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was
 7326: concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,
 7327: Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote
 7328: the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to
 7329: reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty
 7330: to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which
 7331: suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us
 7332: everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the
 7333: matter."
 7334: 
 7335: "Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation
 7336: lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions
 7337: depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to
 7338: another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to
 7339: look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it
 7340: as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can
 7341: read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have
 7342: heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold
 7343: wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid
 7344: the dangers which encompass me."
 7345: 
 7346: "I am all attention, madam."
 7347: 
 7348: "My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who
 7349: is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in
 7350: England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of
 7351: Surrey."
 7352: 
 7353: Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.
 7354: 
 7355: "The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the
 7356: estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north,
 7357: and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four
 7358: successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition,
 7359: and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the
 7360: days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground,
 7361: and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under
 7362: a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence
 7363: there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but
 7364: his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to
 7365: the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which
 7366: enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta,
 7367: where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he
 7368: established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused
 7369: by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he
 7370: beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital
 7371: sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and
 7372: afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.
 7373: 
 7374: "When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner,
 7375: the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery.
 7376: My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old
 7377: at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable
 7378: sum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she
 7379: bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him,
 7380: with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to
 7381: each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return
 7382: to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a
 7383: railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his
 7384: attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us
 7385: to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The
 7386: money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and
 7387: there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.
 7388: 
 7389: "But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.
 7390: Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our
 7391: neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of
 7392: Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in
 7393: his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious
 7394: quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper
 7395: approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the
 7396: family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been
 7397: intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of
 7398: disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the
 7399: police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village,
 7400: and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of
 7401: immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
 7402: 
 7403: "Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a
 7404: stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I
 7405: could gather together that I was able to avert another public
 7406: exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies,
 7407: and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few
 7408: acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate,
 7409: and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents,
 7410: wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a
 7411: passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a
 7412: correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon,
 7413: which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the
 7414: villagers almost as much as their master.
 7415: 
 7416: "You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I
 7417: had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with
 7418: us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was
 7419: but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already
 7420: begun to whiten, even as mine has."
 7421: 
 7422: "Your sister is dead, then?"
 7423: 
 7424: "She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish
 7425: to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I
 7426: have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own
 7427: age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden
 7428: sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we
 7429: were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's
 7430: house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there
 7431: a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My
 7432: stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and
 7433: offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of
 7434: the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event
 7435: occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."
 7436: 
 7437: Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes
 7438: closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his
 7439: lids now and glanced across at his visitor.
 7440: 
 7441: "Pray be precise as to details," said he.
 7442: 
 7443: "It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful
 7444: time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have
 7445: already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The
 7446: bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms
 7447: being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms
 7448: the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third
 7449: my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open
 7450: out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"
 7451: 
 7452: "Perfectly so."
 7453: 
 7454: "The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That
 7455: fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we
 7456: knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled
 7457: by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom
 7458: to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where
 7459: she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At
 7460: eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door
 7461: and looked back.
 7462: 
 7463: "'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle
 7464: in the dead of the night?'
 7465: 
 7466: "'Never,' said I.
 7467: 
 7468: "'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in
 7469: your sleep?'
 7470: 
 7471: "'Certainly not. But why?'
 7472: 
 7473: "'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three
 7474: in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper,
 7475: and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps
 7476: from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would
 7477: just ask you whether you had heard it.'
 7478: 
 7479: "'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the
 7480: plantation.'
 7481: 
 7482: "'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you
 7483: did not hear it also.'
 7484: 
 7485: "'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'
 7486: 
 7487: "'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled
 7488: back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her
 7489: key turn in the lock."
 7490: 
 7491: "Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock
 7492: yourselves in at night?"
 7493: 
 7494: "Always."
 7495: 
 7496: "And why?"
 7497: 
 7498: "I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah
 7499: and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were
 7500: locked."
 7501: 
 7502: "Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."
 7503: 
 7504: "I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending
 7505: misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect,
 7506: were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two
 7507: souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind
 7508: was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing
 7509: against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale,
 7510: there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew
 7511: that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a
 7512: shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door
 7513: I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and
 7514: a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had
 7515: fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked,
 7516: and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it
 7517: horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By
 7518: the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the
 7519: opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for
 7520: help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a
 7521: drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that
 7522: moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.
 7523: She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were
 7524: dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not
 7525: recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out
 7526: in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was
 7527: the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she
 7528: would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the
 7529: air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion
 7530: seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for
 7531: my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his
 7532: dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was
 7533: unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent
 7534: for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for
 7535: she slowly sank and died without having recovered her
 7536: consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."
 7537: 
 7538: "One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and
 7539: metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"
 7540: 
 7541: "That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is
 7542: my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of
 7543: the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have
 7544: been deceived."
 7545: 
 7546: "Was your sister dressed?"
 7547: 
 7548: "No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the
 7549: charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."
 7550: 
 7551: "Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when
 7552: the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did
 7553: the coroner come to?"
 7554: 
 7555: "He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's
 7556: conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable
 7557: to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that
 7558: the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows
 7559: were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars,
 7560: which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded,
 7561: and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was
 7562: also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is
 7563: wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain,
 7564: therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.
 7565: Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."
 7566: 
 7567: "How about poison?"
 7568: 
 7569: "The doctors examined her for it, but without success."
 7570: 
 7571: "What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"
 7572: 
 7573: "It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock,
 7574: though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."
 7575: 
 7576: "Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"
 7577: 
 7578: "Yes, there are nearly always some there."
 7579: 
 7580: "Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a
 7581: speckled band?"
 7582: 
 7583: "Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of
 7584: delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of
 7585: people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not
 7586: know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear
 7587: over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which
 7588: she used."
 7589: 
 7590: Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.
 7591: 
 7592: "These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your
 7593: narrative."
 7594: 
 7595: "Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until
 7596: lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend,
 7597: whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask
 7598: my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the
 7599: second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My
 7600: stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to
 7601: be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs
 7602: were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom
 7603: wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the
 7604: chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in
 7605: which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last
 7606: night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I
 7607: suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which
 7608: had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the
 7609: lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to
 7610: go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was
 7611: daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which
 7612: is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on
 7613: this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your
 7614: advice."
 7615: 
 7616: "You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me
 7617: all?"
 7618: 
 7619: "Yes, all."
 7620: 
 7621: "Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather."
 7622: 
 7623: "Why, what do you mean?"
 7624: 
 7625: For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which
 7626: fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little
 7627: livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed
 7628: upon the white wrist.
 7629: 
 7630: "You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.
 7631: 
 7632: The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He
 7633: is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own
 7634: strength."
 7635: 
 7636: There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin
 7637: upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.
 7638: 
 7639: "This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a
 7640: thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide
 7641: upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If
 7642: we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for
 7643: us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your
 7644: stepfather?"
 7645: 
 7646: "As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some
 7647: most important business. It is probable that he will be away all
 7648: day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a
 7649: housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily
 7650: get her out of the way."
 7651: 
 7652: "Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"
 7653: 
 7654: "By no means."
 7655: 
 7656: "Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"
 7657: 
 7658: "I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am
 7659: in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to
 7660: be there in time for your coming."
 7661: 
 7662: "And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some
 7663: small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and
 7664: breakfast?"
 7665: 
 7666: "No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have
 7667: confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you
 7668: again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her
 7669: face and glided from the room.
 7670: 
 7671: "And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes,
 7672: leaning back in his chair.
 7673: 
 7674: "It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."
 7675: 
 7676: "Dark enough and sinister enough."
 7677: 
 7678: "Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls
 7679: are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,
 7680: then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her
 7681: mysterious end."
 7682: 
 7683: "What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the
 7684: very peculiar words of the dying woman?"
 7685: 
 7686: "I cannot think."
 7687: 
 7688: "When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of
 7689: a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor,
 7690: the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has
 7691: an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying
 7692: allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner
 7693: heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of
 7694: those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its
 7695: place, I think that there is good ground to think that the
 7696: mystery may be cleared along those lines."
 7697: 
 7698: "But what, then, did the gipsies do?"
 7699: 
 7700: "I cannot imagine."
 7701: 
 7702: "I see many objections to any such theory."
 7703: 
 7704: "And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going
 7705: to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are
 7706: fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of
 7707: the devil!"
 7708: 
 7709: The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that
 7710: our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had
 7711: framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar
 7712: mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a
 7713: black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters,
 7714: with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his
 7715: hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his
 7716: breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,
 7717: seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and
 7718: marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other
 7719: of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,
 7720: fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old
 7721: bird of prey.
 7722: 
 7723: "Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.
 7724: 
 7725: "My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my
 7726: companion quietly.
 7727: 
 7728: "I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."
 7729: 
 7730: "Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."
 7731: 
 7732: "I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I
 7733: have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"
 7734: 
 7735: "It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.
 7736: 
 7737: "What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man
 7738: furiously.
 7739: 
 7740: "But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my
 7741: companion imperturbably.
 7742: 
 7743: "Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step
 7744: forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel!
 7745: I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."
 7746: 
 7747: My friend smiled.
 7748: 
 7749: "Holmes, the busybody!"
 7750: 
 7751: His smile broadened.
 7752: 
 7753: "Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"
 7754: 
 7755: Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most
 7756: entertaining," said he. "When you go out close the door, for
 7757: there is a decided draught."
 7758: 
 7759: "I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with
 7760: my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her!
 7761: I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped
 7762: swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with
 7763: his huge brown hands.
 7764: 
 7765: "See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and
 7766: hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the
 7767: room.
 7768: 
 7769: "He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am
 7770: not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him
 7771: that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke
 7772: he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort,
 7773: straightened it out again.
 7774: 
 7775: "Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
 7776: detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,
 7777: however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer
 7778: from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now,
 7779: Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk
 7780: down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may
 7781: help us in this matter."
 7782: 
 7783: 
 7784: It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his
 7785: excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled
 7786: over with notes and figures.
 7787: 
 7788: "I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To
 7789: determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the
 7790: present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The
 7791: total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little
 7792: short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural
 7793: prices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an
 7794: income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident,
 7795: therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have
 7796: had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to
 7797: a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted,
 7798: since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for
 7799: standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson,
 7800: this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is
 7801: aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you
 7802: are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be
 7803: very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your
 7804: pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen
 7805: who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush
 7806: are, I think, all that we need."
 7807: 
 7808: At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for
 7809: Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove
 7810: for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a
 7811: perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the
 7812: heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out
 7813: their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant
 7814: smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange
 7815: contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this
 7816: sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in
 7817: the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over
 7818: his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the
 7819: deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the
 7820: shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.
 7821: 
 7822: "Look there!" said he.
 7823: 
 7824: A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope,
 7825: thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the
 7826: branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a
 7827: very old mansion.
 7828: 
 7829: "Stoke Moran?" said he.
 7830: 
 7831: "Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked
 7832: the driver.
 7833: 
 7834: "There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is
 7835: where we are going."
 7836: 
 7837: "There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of
 7838: roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the
 7839: house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by
 7840: the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is
 7841: walking."
 7842: 
 7843: "And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading
 7844: his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."
 7845: 
 7846: We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way
 7847: to Leatherhead.
 7848: 
 7849: "I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile,
 7850: "that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or
 7851: on some definite business. It may stop his gossip.
 7852: Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as
 7853: our word."
 7854: 
 7855: Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a
 7856: face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for
 7857: you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned
 7858: out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely
 7859: that he will be back before evening."
 7860: 
 7861: "We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance,"
 7862: said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had
 7863: occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.
 7864: 
 7865: "Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."
 7866: 
 7867: "So it appears."
 7868: 
 7869: "He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What
 7870: will he say when he returns?"
 7871: 
 7872: "He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone
 7873: more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself
 7874: up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to
 7875: your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our
 7876: time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to
 7877: examine."
 7878: 
 7879: The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high
 7880: central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab,
 7881: thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were
 7882: broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly
 7883: caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little
 7884: better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,
 7885: and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up
 7886: from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.
 7887: Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the
 7888: stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any
 7889: workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and
 7890: down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the
 7891: outsides of the windows.
 7892: 
 7893: "This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep,
 7894: the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main
 7895: building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"
 7896: 
 7897: "Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."
 7898: 
 7899: "Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does
 7900: not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end
 7901: wall."
 7902: 
 7903: "There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from
 7904: my room."
 7905: 
 7906: "Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow
 7907: wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There
 7908: are windows in it, of course?"
 7909: 
 7910: "Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass
 7911: through."
 7912: 
 7913: "As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were
 7914: unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness
 7915: to go into your room and bar your shutters?"
 7916: 
 7917: Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination
 7918: through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the
 7919: shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through
 7920: which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his
 7921: lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built
 7922: firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his
 7923: chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some
 7924: difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were
 7925: bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon
 7926: the matter."
 7927: 
 7928: A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which
 7929: the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third
 7930: chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss
 7931: Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her
 7932: fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a
 7933: gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A
 7934: brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow
 7935: white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the
 7936: left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small
 7937: wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save
 7938: for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and
 7939: the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old
 7940: and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building
 7941: of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat
 7942: silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down,
 7943: taking in every detail of the apartment.
 7944: 
 7945: "Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last
 7946: pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the
 7947: tassel actually lying upon the pillow.
 7948: 
 7949: "It goes to the housekeeper's room."
 7950: 
 7951: "It looks newer than the other things?"
 7952: 
 7953: "Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."
 7954: 
 7955: "Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"
 7956: 
 7957: "No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we
 7958: wanted for ourselves."
 7959: 
 7960: "Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.
 7961: You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to
 7962: this floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in
 7963: his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining
 7964: minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with
 7965: the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he
 7966: walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and
 7967: in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the
 7968: bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.
 7969: 
 7970: "Why, it's a dummy," said he.
 7971: 
 7972: "Won't it ring?"
 7973: 
 7974: "No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting.
 7975: You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where
 7976: the little opening for the ventilator is."
 7977: 
 7978: "How very absurd! I never noticed that before."
 7979: 
 7980: "Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are
 7981: one or two very singular points about this room. For example,
 7982: what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another
 7983: room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated
 7984: with the outside air!"
 7985: 
 7986: "That is also quite modern," said the lady.
 7987: 
 7988: "Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.
 7989: 
 7990: "Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that
 7991: time."
 7992: 
 7993: "They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy
 7994: bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your
 7995: permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into
 7996: the inner apartment."
 7997: 
 7998: Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his
 7999: step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small
 8000: wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an
 8001: armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a
 8002: round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things
 8003: which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each
 8004: and all of them with the keenest interest.
 8005: 
 8006: "What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.
 8007: 
 8008: "My stepfather's business papers."
 8009: 
 8010: "Oh! you have seen inside, then?"
 8011: 
 8012: "Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of
 8013: papers."
 8014: 
 8015: "There isn't a cat in it, for example?"
 8016: 
 8017: "No. What a strange idea!"
 8018: 
 8019: "Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which
 8020: stood on the top of it.
 8021: 
 8022: "No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."
 8023: 
 8024: "Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a
 8025: saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I
 8026: daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He
 8027: squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat
 8028: of it with the greatest attention.
 8029: 
 8030: "Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting
 8031: his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"
 8032: 
 8033: The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on
 8034: one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself
 8035: and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.
 8036: 
 8037: "What do you make of that, Watson?"
 8038: 
 8039: "It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be
 8040: tied."
 8041: 
 8042: "That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world,
 8043: and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst
 8044: of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and
 8045: with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."
 8046: 
 8047: I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as
 8048: it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We
 8049: had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss
 8050: Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he
 8051: roused himself from his reverie.
 8052: 
 8053: "It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should
 8054: absolutely follow my advice in every respect."
 8055: 
 8056: "I shall most certainly do so."
 8057: 
 8058: "The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may
 8059: depend upon your compliance."
 8060: 
 8061: "I assure you that I am in your hands."
 8062: 
 8063: "In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in
 8064: your room."
 8065: 
 8066: Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.
 8067: 
 8068: "Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the
 8069: village inn over there?"
 8070: 
 8071: "Yes, that is the Crown."
 8072: 
 8073: "Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"
 8074: 
 8075: "Certainly."
 8076: 
 8077: "You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a
 8078: headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him
 8079: retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window,
 8080: undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then
 8081: withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want
 8082: into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in
 8083: spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."
 8084: 
 8085: "Oh, yes, easily."
 8086: 
 8087: "The rest you will leave in our hands."
 8088: 
 8089: "But what will you do?"
 8090: 
 8091: "We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate
 8092: the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."
 8093: 
 8094: "I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,"
 8095: said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.
 8096: 
 8097: "Perhaps I have."
 8098: 
 8099: "Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's
 8100: death."
 8101: 
 8102: "I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."
 8103: 
 8104: "You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and
 8105: if she died from some sudden fright."
 8106: 
 8107: "No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more
 8108: tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if
 8109: Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.
 8110: Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,
 8111: you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers
 8112: that threaten you."
 8113: 
 8114: Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and
 8115: sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and
 8116: from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and
 8117: of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw
 8118: Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside
 8119: the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some
 8120: slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard
 8121: the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which
 8122: he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few
 8123: minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as
 8124: the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
 8125: 
 8126: "Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the
 8127: gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you
 8128: to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."
 8129: 
 8130: "Can I be of assistance?"
 8131: 
 8132: "Your presence might be invaluable."
 8133: 
 8134: "Then I shall certainly come."
 8135: 
 8136: "It is very kind of you."
 8137: 
 8138: "You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms
 8139: than was visible to me."
 8140: 
 8141: "No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine
 8142: that you saw all that I did."
 8143: 
 8144: "I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose
 8145: that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."
 8146: 
 8147: "You saw the ventilator, too?"
 8148: 
 8149: "Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to
 8150: have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a
 8151: rat could hardly pass through."
 8152: 
 8153: "I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to
 8154: Stoke Moran."
 8155: 
 8156: "My dear Holmes!"
 8157: 
 8158: "Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her
 8159: sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that
 8160: suggested at once that there must be a communication between the
 8161: two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been
 8162: remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."
 8163: 
 8164: "But what harm can there be in that?"
 8165: 
 8166: "Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A
 8167: ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the
 8168: bed dies. Does not that strike you?"
 8169: 
 8170: "I cannot as yet see any connection."
 8171: 
 8172: "Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"
 8173: 
 8174: "No."
 8175: 
 8176: "It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened
 8177: like that before?"
 8178: 
 8179: "I cannot say that I have."
 8180: 
 8181: "The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same
 8182: relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may
 8183: call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."
 8184: 
 8185: "Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.
 8186: We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible
 8187: crime."
 8188: 
 8189: "Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong
 8190: he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge.
 8191: Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.
 8192: This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall
 8193: be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough
 8194: before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet
 8195: pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more
 8196: cheerful."
 8197: 
 8198: 
 8199: About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished,
 8200: and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours
 8201: passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of
 8202: eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.
 8203: 
 8204: "That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it
 8205: comes from the middle window."
 8206: 
 8207: As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,
 8208: explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,
 8209: and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A
 8210: moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing
 8211: in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us
 8212: through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.
 8213: 
 8214: There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for
 8215: unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way
 8216: among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about
 8217: to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel
 8218: bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted
 8219: child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and
 8220: then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.
 8221: 
 8222: "My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"
 8223: 
 8224: Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like
 8225: a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low
 8226: laugh and put his lips to my ear.
 8227: 
 8228: "It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."
 8229: 
 8230: I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There
 8231: was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders
 8232: at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when,
 8233: after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I
 8234: found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed
 8235: the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes
 8236: round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then
 8237: creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered
 8238: into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to
 8239: distinguish the words:
 8240: 
 8241: "The least sound would be fatal to our plans."
 8242: 
 8243: I nodded to show that I had heard.
 8244: 
 8245: "We must sit without light. He would see it through the
 8246: ventilator."
 8247: 
 8248: I nodded again.
 8249: 
 8250: "Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your
 8251: pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of
 8252: the bed, and you in that chair."
 8253: 
 8254: I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.
 8255: 
 8256: Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon
 8257: the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the
 8258: stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left
 8259: in darkness.
 8260: 
 8261: How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a
 8262: sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my
 8263: companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same
 8264: state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut
 8265: off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.
 8266: 
 8267: From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at
 8268: our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that
 8269: the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the
 8270: deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of
 8271: an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and
 8272: one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for
 8273: whatever might befall.
 8274: 
 8275: Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the
 8276: direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was
 8277: succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.
 8278: Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle
 8279: sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the
 8280: smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.
 8281: Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle,
 8282: soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping
 8283: continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes
 8284: sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with
 8285: his cane at the bell-pull.
 8286: 
 8287: "You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"
 8288: 
 8289: But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I
 8290: heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my
 8291: weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which
 8292: my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face
 8293: was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had
 8294: ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when
 8295: suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most
 8296: horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder
 8297: and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled
 8298: in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the
 8299: village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the
 8300: sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I
 8301: stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it
 8302: had died away into the silence from which it rose.
 8303: 
 8304: "What can it mean?" I gasped.
 8305: 
 8306: "It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps,
 8307: after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will
 8308: enter Dr. Roylott's room."
 8309: 
 8310: With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the
 8311: corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply
 8312: from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his
 8313: heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.
 8314: 
 8315: It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a
 8316: dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant
 8317: beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.
 8318: Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott
 8319: clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding
 8320: beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.
 8321: Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we
 8322: had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his
 8323: eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the
 8324: ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with
 8325: brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his
 8326: head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.
 8327: 
 8328: "The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.
 8329: 
 8330: I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began
 8331: to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
 8332: diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
 8333: 
 8334: "It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in
 8335: India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence
 8336: does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls
 8337: into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this
 8338: creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to
 8339: some place of shelter and let the county police know what has
 8340: happened."
 8341: 
 8342: As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap,
 8343: and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from
 8344: its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into
 8345: the iron safe, which he closed upon it.
 8346: 
 8347: Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of
 8348: Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a
 8349: narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling
 8350: how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed
 8351: her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,
 8352: of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the
 8353: conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly
 8354: playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn
 8355: of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back
 8356: next day.
 8357: 
 8358: "I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which
 8359: shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from
 8360: insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of
 8361: the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to
 8362: explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of
 8363: by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an
 8364: entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly
 8365: reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me
 8366: that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not
 8367: come either from the window or the door. My attention was
 8368: speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this
 8369: ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The
 8370: discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to
 8371: the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was
 8372: there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and
 8373: coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,
 8374: and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was
 8375: furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I
 8376: was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of
 8377: poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical
 8378: test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless
 8379: man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such
 8380: a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be
 8381: an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could
 8382: distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
 8383: the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the
 8384: whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning
 8385: light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by
 8386: the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.
 8387: He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he
 8388: thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the
 8389: rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the
 8390: occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but
 8391: sooner or later she must fall a victim.
 8392: 
 8393: "I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his
 8394: room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in
 8395: the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary
 8396: in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the
 8397: safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to
 8398: finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic
 8399: clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather
 8400: hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.
 8401: Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in
 8402: order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss
 8403: as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the
 8404: light and attacked it."
 8405: 
 8406: "With the result of driving it through the ventilator."
 8407: 
 8408: "And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master
 8409: at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and
 8410: roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person
 8411: it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.
 8412: Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to
 8413: weigh very heavily upon my conscience."
 8414: 
 8415: 
 8416: 
 8417: IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
 8418: 
 8419: Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.
 8420: Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy,
 8421: there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his
 8422: notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel
 8423: Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a
 8424: finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was
 8425: so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that
 8426: it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it
 8427: gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of
 8428: reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story
 8429: has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,
 8430: like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when
 8431: set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the
 8432: facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears
 8433: gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads
 8434: on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a
 8435: deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly
 8436: served to weaken the effect.
 8437: 
 8438: It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the
 8439: events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned
 8440: to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker
 8441: Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally
 8442: even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come
 8443: and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I
 8444: happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington
 8445: Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of
 8446: these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was
 8447: never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send
 8448: me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.
 8449: 
 8450: One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by
 8451: the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come
 8452: from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I
 8453: dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases
 8454: were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my
 8455: old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door
 8456: tightly behind him.
 8457: 
 8458: "I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his
 8459: shoulder; "he's all right."
 8460: 
 8461: "What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was
 8462: some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.
 8463: 
 8464: "It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him
 8465: round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe
 8466: and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the
 8467: same as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even
 8468: giving me time to thank him.
 8469: 
 8470: I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the
 8471: table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a
 8472: soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of
 8473: his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all
 8474: over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than
 8475: five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but
 8476: he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who
 8477: was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his
 8478: strength of mind to control.
 8479: 
 8480: "I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I
 8481: have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by
 8482: train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I
 8483: might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me
 8484: here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon
 8485: the side-table."
 8486: 
 8487: I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic
 8488: engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name,
 8489: style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have
 8490: kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You
 8491: are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself
 8492: a monotonous occupation."
 8493: 
 8494: "Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and
 8495: laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note,
 8496: leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical
 8497: instincts rose up against that laugh.
 8498: 
 8499: "Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out
 8500: some water from a caraffe.
 8501: 
 8502: It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical
 8503: outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis
 8504: is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very
 8505: weary and pale-looking.
 8506: 
 8507: "I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.
 8508: 
 8509: "Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water,
 8510: and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.
 8511: 
 8512: "That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would
 8513: kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb
 8514: used to be."
 8515: 
 8516: He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even
 8517: my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four
 8518: protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the
 8519: thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from
 8520: the roots.
 8521: 
 8522: "Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have
 8523: bled considerably."
 8524: 
 8525: "Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must
 8526: have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that
 8527: it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very
 8528: tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."
 8529: 
 8530: "Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."
 8531: 
 8532: "It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own
 8533: province."
 8534: 
 8535: "This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very
 8536: heavy and sharp instrument."
 8537: 
 8538: "A thing like a cleaver," said he.
 8539: 
 8540: "An accident, I presume?"
 8541: 
 8542: "By no means."
 8543: 
 8544: "What! a murderous attack?"
 8545: 
 8546: "Very murderous indeed."
 8547: 
 8548: "You horrify me."
 8549: 
 8550: I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered
 8551: it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back
 8552: without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.
 8553: 
 8554: "How is that?" I asked when I had finished.
 8555: 
 8556: "Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.
 8557: I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."
 8558: 
 8559: "Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently
 8560: trying to your nerves."
 8561: 
 8562: "Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police;
 8563: but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing
 8564: evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they
 8565: believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I
 8566: have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and,
 8567: even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so
 8568: vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."
 8569: 
 8570: "Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem
 8571: which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you
 8572: to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the
 8573: official police."
 8574: 
 8575: "Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I
 8576: should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of
 8577: course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me
 8578: an introduction to him?"
 8579: 
 8580: "I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."
 8581: 
 8582: "I should be immensely obliged to you."
 8583: 
 8584: "We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to
 8585: have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?"
 8586: 
 8587: "Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."
 8588: 
 8589: "Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an
 8590: instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my
 8591: wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my
 8592: new acquaintance to Baker Street.
 8593: 
 8594: Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his
 8595: sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The
 8596: Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed
 8597: of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day
 8598: before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the
 8599: mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion,
 8600: ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.
 8601: When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the
 8602: sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of
 8603: brandy and water within his reach.
 8604: 
 8605: "It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one,
 8606: Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make yourself
 8607: absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are
 8608: tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."
 8609: 
 8610: "Thank you," said my patient, "but I have felt another man since
 8611: the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has
 8612: completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable
 8613: time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar
 8614: experiences."
 8615: 
 8616: Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded
 8617: expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat
 8618: opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story
 8619: which our visitor detailed to us.
 8620: 
 8621: "You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor,
 8622: residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a
 8623: hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my
 8624: work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &
 8625: Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago,
 8626: having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of
 8627: money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in
 8628: business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria
 8629: Street.
 8630: 
 8631: "I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in
 8632: business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so.
 8633: During two years I have had three consultations and one small
 8634: job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought
 8635: me. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. Every day, from
 8636: nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my
 8637: little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to
 8638: believe that I should never have any practice at all.
 8639: 
 8640: "Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the
 8641: office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who
 8642: wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with
 8643: the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at
 8644: his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle
 8645: size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have
 8646: ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose
 8647: and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over
 8648: his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his
 8649: natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his
 8650: step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly
 8651: dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than
 8652: thirty.
 8653: 
 8654: "'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent.
 8655: 'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man
 8656: who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet
 8657: and capable of preserving a secret.'
 8658: 
 8659: "I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
 8660: address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'
 8661: 
 8662: "'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just
 8663: at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both
 8664: an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'
 8665: 
 8666: "'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if
 8667: I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional
 8668: qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter
 8669: that you wished to speak to me?'
 8670: 
 8671: "'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to
 8672: the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute
 8673: secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and
 8674: of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than
 8675: from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'
 8676: 
 8677: "'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely
 8678: depend upon my doing so.'
 8679: 
 8680: "He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I
 8681: had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.
 8682: 
 8683: "'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.
 8684: 
 8685: "'Yes, I promise.'
 8686: 
 8687: "'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No
 8688: reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'
 8689: 
 8690: "'I have already given you my word.'
 8691: 
 8692: "'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning
 8693: across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was
 8694: empty.
 8695: 
 8696: "'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are
 8697: sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk
 8698: in safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to
 8699: stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.
 8700: 
 8701: "A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun
 8702: to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.
 8703: Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from
 8704: showing my impatience.
 8705: 
 8706: "'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time
 8707: is of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the
 8708: words came to my lips.
 8709: 
 8710: "'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.
 8711: 
 8712: "'Most admirably.'
 8713: 
 8714: "'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I
 8715: simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which
 8716: has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon
 8717: set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as
 8718: that?'
 8719: 
 8720: "'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'
 8721: 
 8722: "'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last
 8723: train.'
 8724: 
 8725: "'Where to?'
 8726: 
 8727: "'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders
 8728: of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a
 8729: train from Paddington which would bring you there at about
 8730: 11:15.'
 8731: 
 8732: "'Very good.'
 8733: 
 8734: "'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'
 8735: 
 8736: "'There is a drive, then?'
 8737: 
 8738: "'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good
 8739: seven miles from Eyford Station.'
 8740: 
 8741: "'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there
 8742: would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop
 8743: the night.'
 8744: 
 8745: "'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'
 8746: 
 8747: "'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient
 8748: hour?'
 8749: 
 8750: "'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to
 8751: recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a
 8752: young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the
 8753: very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would
 8754: like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do
 8755: so.'
 8756: 
 8757: "I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they
 8758: would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to
 8759: accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to
 8760: understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to
 8761: do.'
 8762: 
 8763: "'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which
 8764: we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I
 8765: have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all
 8766: laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from
 8767: eavesdroppers?'
 8768: 
 8769: "'Entirely.'
 8770: 
 8771: "'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that
 8772: fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found
 8773: in one or two places in England?'
 8774: 
 8775: "'I have heard so.'
 8776: 
 8777: "'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small
 8778: place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to
 8779: discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my
 8780: fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a
 8781: comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two
 8782: very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them,
 8783: however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were
 8784: absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was
 8785: quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my
 8786: interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value,
 8787: but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I
 8788: took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they
 8789: suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little
 8790: deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would
 8791: enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been
 8792: doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we
 8793: erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already
 8794: explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the
 8795: subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it
 8796: once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our
 8797: little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts
 8798: came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these
 8799: fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you
 8800: promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are
 8801: going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'
 8802: 
 8803: "'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not
 8804: quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press
 8805: in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out
 8806: like gravel from a pit.'
 8807: 
 8808: "'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress
 8809: the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing
 8810: what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully
 8811: into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I
 8812: trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at
 8813: Eyford at 11:15.'
 8814: 
 8815: "'I shall certainly be there.'
 8816: 
 8817: "'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long,
 8818: questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank
 8819: grasp, he hurried from the room.
 8820: 
 8821: "Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very
 8822: much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission
 8823: which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was
 8824: glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked
 8825: had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that
 8826: this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face
 8827: and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon
 8828: me, and I could not think that his explanation of the
 8829: fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my
 8830: coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell
 8831: anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate
 8832: a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having
 8833: obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
 8834: 
 8835: "At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.
 8836: However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I
 8837: reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the
 8838: only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the
 8839: platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed
 8840: out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of
 8841: the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a
 8842: word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door
 8843: of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either
 8844: side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the
 8845: horse could go."
 8846: 
 8847: "One horse?" interjected Holmes.
 8848: 
 8849: "Yes, only one."
 8850: 
 8851: "Did you observe the colour?"
 8852: 
 8853: "Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the
 8854: carriage. It was a chestnut."
 8855: 
 8856: "Tired-looking or fresh?"
 8857: 
 8858: "Oh, fresh and glossy."
 8859: 
 8860: "Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue
 8861: your most interesting statement."
 8862: 
 8863: "Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel
 8864: Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I
 8865: should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the
 8866: time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat
 8867: at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than
 8868: once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me
 8869: with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good
 8870: in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I
 8871: tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we
 8872: were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out
 8873: nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now
 8874: and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the
 8875: journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the
 8876: conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the
 8877: road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive,
 8878: and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang
 8879: out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch
 8880: which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of
 8881: the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the
 8882: most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that
 8883: I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,
 8884: and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
 8885: drove away.
 8886: 
 8887: "It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled
 8888: about looking for matches and muttering under his breath.
 8889: Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a
 8890: long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew
 8891: broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she
 8892: held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.
 8893: I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which
 8894: the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich
 8895: material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as
 8896: though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a
 8897: gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly
 8898: fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered
 8899: something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room
 8900: from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the
 8901: lamp in his hand.
 8902: 
 8903: "'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a
 8904: few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a
 8905: quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the
 8906: centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel
 8907: Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the
 8908: door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and
 8909: vanished into the darkness.
 8910: 
 8911: "I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my
 8912: ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises
 8913: on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked
 8914: across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of
 8915: the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded
 8916: across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old
 8917: clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise
 8918: everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began
 8919: to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were
 8920: they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And
 8921: where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was
 8922: all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no
 8923: idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns,
 8924: were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded,
 8925: after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,
 8926: that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,
 8927: humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling
 8928: that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.
 8929: 
 8930: "Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the
 8931: utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman
 8932: was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind
 8933: her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and
 8934: beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with
 8935: fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one
 8936: shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few
 8937: whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back,
 8938: like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.
 8939: 
 8940: "'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to
 8941: speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no
 8942: good for you to do.'
 8943: 
 8944: "'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I
 8945: cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'
 8946: 
 8947: "'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass
 8948: through the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled
 8949: and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and
 8950: made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love
 8951: of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too
 8952: late!'
 8953: 
 8954: "But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to
 8955: engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I
 8956: thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of
 8957: the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to
 8958: go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried
 8959: out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This
 8960: woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout
 8961: bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I
 8962: cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention
 8963: of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties
 8964: when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps
 8965: was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up
 8966: her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and
 8967: as noiselessly as she had come.
 8968: 
 8969: "The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man
 8970: with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double
 8971: chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.
 8972: 
 8973: "'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the
 8974: way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just
 8975: now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'
 8976: 
 8977: "'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I
 8978: felt the room to be a little close.'
 8979: 
 8980: "He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had
 8981: better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I
 8982: will take you up to see the machine.'
 8983: 
 8984: "'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'
 8985: 
 8986: "'Oh, no, it is in the house.'
 8987: 
 8988: "'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'
 8989: 
 8990: "'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that.
 8991: All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us
 8992: know what is wrong with it.'
 8993: 
 8994: "We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the
 8995: fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house,
 8996: with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little
 8997: low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the
 8998: generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no
 8999: signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster
 9000: was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in
 9001: green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an
 9002: air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the
 9003: lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon
 9004: my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent
 9005: man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at
 9006: least a fellow-countryman.
 9007: 
 9008: "Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which
 9009: he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three
 9010: of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside,
 9011: and the colonel ushered me in.
 9012: 
 9013: "'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and
 9014: it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were
 9015: to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the
 9016: end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of
 9017: many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns
 9018: of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and
 9019: multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine
 9020: goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working
 9021: of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will
 9022: have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set
 9023: it right.'
 9024: 
 9025: "I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very
 9026: thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of
 9027: exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and
 9028: pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by
 9029: the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed
 9030: a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An
 9031: examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was
 9032: round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to
 9033: fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause
 9034: of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who
 9035: followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical
 9036: questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I
 9037: had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the
 9038: machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.
 9039: It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth
 9040: was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose
 9041: that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a
 9042: purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a
 9043: large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a
 9044: crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was
 9045: scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a
 9046: muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the
 9047: colonel looking down at me.
 9048: 
 9049: "'What are you doing there?' he asked.
 9050: 
 9051: "I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as
 9052: that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,'
 9053: said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to
 9054: your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it
 9055: was used.'
 9056: 
 9057: "The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of
 9058: my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in
 9059: his grey eyes.
 9060: 
 9061: "'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He
 9062: took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key
 9063: in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it
 9064: was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and
 9065: shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'
 9066: 
 9067: "And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my
 9068: heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish
 9069: of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp
 9070: still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining
 9071: the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming
 9072: down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than
 9073: myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a
 9074: shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and
 9075: dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let
 9076: me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my
 9077: cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with
 9078: my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it
 9079: flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
 9080: very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my
 9081: face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to
 9082: think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and
 9083: yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black
 9084: shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand
 9085: erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope
 9086: back to my heart.
 9087: 
 9088: "I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the
 9089: walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw
 9090: a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which
 9091: broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For
 9092: an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door
 9093: which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself
 9094: through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had
 9095: closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few
 9096: moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me
 9097: how narrow had been my escape.
 9098: 
 9099: "I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and
 9100: I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor,
 9101: while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,
 9102: while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend
 9103: whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.
 9104: 
 9105: "'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a
 9106: moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste
 9107: the so-precious time, but come!'
 9108: 
 9109: "This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to
 9110: my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding
 9111: stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we
 9112: reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of
 9113: two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which  we
 9114: were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about
 9115: her like one  who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door
 9116: which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon
 9117: was shining brightly.
 9118: 
 9119: "'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be
 9120: that you can jump it.'
 9121: 
 9122: "As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the
 9123: passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark
 9124: rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a
 9125: butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom,
 9126: flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and
 9127: wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be
 9128: more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I
 9129: hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between
 9130: my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used,
 9131: then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.
 9132: The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at
 9133: the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round
 9134: him and tried to hold him back.
 9135: 
 9136: "'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise
 9137: after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be
 9138: silent! Oh, he will be silent!'
 9139: 
 9140: "'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from
 9141: her. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me
 9142: pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the
 9143: window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and
 9144: was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was
 9145: conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the
 9146: garden below.
 9147: 
 9148: "I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and
 9149: rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I
 9150: understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly,
 9151: however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.
 9152: I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and
 9153: then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and
 9154: that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my
 9155: handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my
 9156: ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the
 9157: rose-bushes.
 9158: 
 9159: "How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been
 9160: a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was
 9161: breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with
 9162: dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded
 9163: thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the
 9164: particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with
 9165: the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But
 9166: to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house
 9167: nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the
 9168: hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a
 9169: long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the
 9170: very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were
 9171: it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed
 9172: during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
 9173: 
 9174: "Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning
 9175: train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The
 9176: same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I
 9177: arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel
 9178: Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a
 9179: carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was
 9180: there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three
 9181: miles off.
 9182: 
 9183: "It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined
 9184: to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the
 9185: police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first
 9186: to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to
 9187: bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do
 9188: exactly what you advise."
 9189: 
 9190: We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to
 9191: this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down
 9192: from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he
 9193: placed his cuttings.
 9194: 
 9195: "Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It
 9196: appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:
 9197: 'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged
 9198: twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten
 9199: o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was
 9200: dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that
 9201: the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."
 9202: 
 9203: "Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the
 9204: girl said."
 9205: 
 9206: "Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
 9207: desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should
 9208: stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out
 9209: pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well,
 9210: every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall
 9211: go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for
 9212: Eyford."
 9213: 
 9214: Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train
 9215: together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.
 9216: There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector
 9217: Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.
 9218: Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the
 9219: seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford
 9220: for its centre.
 9221: 
 9222: "There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of
 9223: ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere
 9224: near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."
 9225: 
 9226: "It was an hour's good drive."
 9227: 
 9228: "And you think that they brought you back all that way when you
 9229: were unconscious?"
 9230: 
 9231: "They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having
 9232: been lifted and conveyed somewhere."
 9233: 
 9234: "What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have
 9235: spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.
 9236: Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."
 9237: 
 9238: "I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face
 9239: in my life."
 9240: 
 9241: "Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I
 9242: have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon
 9243: it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."
 9244: 
 9245: "I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.
 9246: 
 9247: "Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your
 9248: opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is
 9249: south, for the country is more deserted there."
 9250: 
 9251: "And I say east," said my patient.
 9252: 
 9253: "I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are
 9254: several quiet little villages up there."
 9255: 
 9256: "And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there,
 9257: and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up
 9258: any."
 9259: 
 9260: "Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty
 9261: diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do
 9262: you give your casting vote to?"
 9263: 
 9264: "You are all wrong."
 9265: 
 9266: "But we can't all be."
 9267: 
 9268: "Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the
 9269: centre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."
 9270: 
 9271: "But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.
 9272: 
 9273: "Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the
 9274: horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that
 9275: if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"
 9276: 
 9277: "Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet
 9278: thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature
 9279: of this gang."
 9280: 
 9281: "None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale,
 9282: and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the
 9283: place of silver."
 9284: 
 9285: "We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,"
 9286: said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by
 9287: the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could
 9288: get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that
 9289: showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this
 9290: lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."
 9291: 
 9292: But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not
 9293: destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into
 9294: Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed
 9295: up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and
 9296: hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.
 9297: 
 9298: "A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off
 9299: again on its way.
 9300: 
 9301: "Yes, sir!" said the station-master.
 9302: 
 9303: "When did it break out?"
 9304: 
 9305: "I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse,
 9306: and the whole place is in a blaze."
 9307: 
 9308: "Whose house is it?"
 9309: 
 9310: "Dr. Becher's."
 9311: 
 9312: "Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very
 9313: thin, with a long, sharp nose?"
 9314: 
 9315: The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an
 9316: Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a
 9317: better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him,
 9318: a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as
 9319: if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."
 9320: 
 9321: The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
 9322: hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low
 9323: hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in
 9324: front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in
 9325: the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to
 9326: keep the flames under.
 9327: 
 9328: "That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is
 9329: the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That
 9330: second window is the one that I jumped from."
 9331: 
 9332: "Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon
 9333: them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which,
 9334: when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls,
 9335: though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to
 9336: observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for
 9337: your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are
 9338: a good hundred miles off by now."
 9339: 
 9340: And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this
 9341: no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the
 9342: sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a
 9343: peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very
 9344: bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but
 9345: there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes'
 9346: ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their
 9347: whereabouts.
 9348: 
 9349: The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
 9350: which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a
 9351: newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.
 9352: About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and
 9353: they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in,
 9354: and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save
 9355: some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of
 9356: the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so
 9357: dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored
 9358: in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have
 9359: explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been
 9360: already referred to.
 9361: 
 9362: How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to
 9363: the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained
 9364: forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a
 9365: very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two
 9366: persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other
 9367: unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the
 9368: silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his
 9369: companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out
 9370: of the way of danger.
 9371: 
 9372: "Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return
 9373: once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I
 9374: have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what
 9375: have I gained?"
 9376: 
 9377: "Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of
 9378: value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the
 9379: reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your
 9380: existence."
 9381: 
 9382: 
 9383: 
 9384: X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
 9385: 
 9386: The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have
 9387: long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles
 9388: in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have
 9389: eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the
 9390: gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to
 9391: believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to
 9392: the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a
 9393: considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no
 9394: memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of
 9395: this remarkable episode.
 9396: 
 9397: It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I
 9398: was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came
 9399: home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table
 9400: waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather
 9401: had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and
 9402: the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as
 9403: a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.
 9404: With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had
 9405: surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last,
 9406: saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and
 9407: lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
 9408: envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's
 9409: noble correspondent could be.
 9410: 
 9411: "Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered.
 9412: "Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a
 9413: fish-monger and a tide-waiter."
 9414: 
 9415: "Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he
 9416: answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more
 9417: interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social
 9418: summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."
 9419: 
 9420: He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
 9421: 
 9422: "Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all."
 9423: 
 9424: "Not social, then?"
 9425: 
 9426: "No, distinctly professional."
 9427: 
 9428: "And from a noble client?"
 9429: 
 9430: "One of the highest in England."
 9431: 
 9432: "My dear fellow, I congratulate you."
 9433: 
 9434: "I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my
 9435: client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his
 9436: case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be
 9437: wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the
 9438: papers diligently of late, have you not?"
 9439: 
 9440: "It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in
 9441: the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."
 9442: 
 9443: "It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I
 9444: read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The
 9445: latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent
 9446: events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his
 9447: wedding?"
 9448: 
 9449: "Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."
 9450: 
 9451: "That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord
 9452: St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn
 9453: over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.
 9454: This is what he says:
 9455: 
 9456: "'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I
 9457: may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I
 9458: have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you
 9459: in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
 9460: connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is
 9461: acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no
 9462: objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that
 9463: it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in
 9464: the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that
 9465: time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of
 9466: paramount importance. Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.'
 9467: 
 9468: "It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen,
 9469: and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink
 9470: upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes
 9471: as he folded up the epistle.
 9472: 
 9473: "He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an
 9474: hour."
 9475: 
 9476: "Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon
 9477: the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in
 9478: their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client
 9479: is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of
 9480: reference beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is," said he, sitting
 9481: down and flattening it out upon his knee. "'Lord Robert Walsingham
 9482: de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms:
 9483: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.'
 9484: He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was
 9485: Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The
 9486: Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.
 9487: They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on
 9488: the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in
 9489: all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something
 9490: more solid."
 9491: 
 9492: "I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I,
 9493: "for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as
 9494: remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew
 9495: that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the
 9496: intrusion of other matters."
 9497: 
 9498: "Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square
 9499: furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it
 9500: was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your
 9501: newspaper selections."
 9502: 
 9503: "Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal
 9504: column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks
 9505: back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if
 9506: rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert
 9507: St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty
 9508: Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San
 9509: Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."
 9510: 
 9511: "Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long,
 9512: thin legs towards the fire.
 9513: 
 9514: "There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society
 9515: papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a
 9516: call for protection in the marriage market, for the present
 9517: free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home
 9518: product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great
 9519: Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across
 9520: the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last
 9521: week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by
 9522: these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself
 9523: for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has
 9524: now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty
 9525: Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss
 9526: Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much
 9527: attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child,
 9528: and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
 9529: considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the
 9530: future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has
 9531: been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years,
 9532: and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small
 9533: estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress
 9534: is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to
 9535: make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a
 9536: British peeress.'"
 9537: 
 9538: "Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.
 9539: 
 9540: "Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post
 9541: to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it
 9542: would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen
 9543: intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would
 9544: return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been
 9545: taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on
 9546: Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had
 9547: taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord
 9548: Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices
 9549: which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."
 9550: 
 9551: "Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.
 9552: 
 9553: "The vanishing of the lady."
 9554: 
 9555: "When did she vanish, then?"
 9556: 
 9557: "At the wedding breakfast."
 9558: 
 9559: "Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite
 9560: dramatic, in fact."
 9561: 
 9562: "Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."
 9563: 
 9564: "They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during
 9565: the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt
 9566: as this. Pray let me have the details."
 9567: 
 9568: "I warn you that they are very incomplete."
 9569: 
 9570: "Perhaps we may make them less so."
 9571: 
 9572: "Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a
 9573: morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is
 9574: headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':
 9575: 
 9576: "'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the
 9577: greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which
 9578: have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as
 9579: shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the
 9580: previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to
 9581: confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently
 9582: floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush
 9583: the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it
 9584: that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what
 9585: is a common subject for conversation.
 9586: 
 9587: "'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover
 9588: Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the
 9589: father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral,
 9590: Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the
 9591: younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia
 9592: Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of
 9593: Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been
 9594: prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a
 9595: woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to
 9596: force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging
 9597: that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a
 9598: painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler
 9599: and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house
 9600: before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast
 9601: with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and
 9602: retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some
 9603: comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that
 9604: she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an
 9605: ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the
 9606: footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus
 9607: apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress,
 9608: believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his
 9609: daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with
 9610: the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with
 9611: the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which
 9612: will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very
 9613: singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing
 9614: had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There
 9615: are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the
 9616: police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the
 9617: original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some
 9618: other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange
 9619: disappearance of the bride.'"
 9620: 
 9621: "And is that all?"
 9622: 
 9623: "Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is
 9624: a suggestive one."
 9625: 
 9626: "And it is--"
 9627: 
 9628: "That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance,
 9629: has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a
 9630: danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom
 9631: for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole
 9632: case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the
 9633: public press."
 9634: 
 9635: "And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would
 9636: not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell,
 9637: Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I
 9638: have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not
 9639: dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness,
 9640: if only as a check to my own memory."
 9641: 
 9642: "Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open
 9643: the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face,
 9644: high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about
 9645: the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose
 9646: pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His
 9647: manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue
 9648: impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little
 9649: bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off
 9650: his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin
 9651: upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of
 9652: foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat,
 9653: yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.
 9654: He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to
 9655: right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his
 9656: golden eyeglasses.
 9657: 
 9658: "Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray
 9659: take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.
 9660: Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this
 9661: matter over."
 9662: 
 9663: "A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine,
 9664: Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you
 9665: have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,
 9666: though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of
 9667: society."
 9668: 
 9669: "No, I am descending."
 9670: 
 9671: "I beg pardon."
 9672: 
 9673: "My last client of the sort was a king."
 9674: 
 9675: "Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"
 9676: 
 9677: "The King of Scandinavia."
 9678: 
 9679: "What! Had he lost his wife?"
 9680: 
 9681: "You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the
 9682: affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to
 9683: you in yours."
 9684: 
 9685: "Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to
 9686: my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may
 9687: assist you in forming an opinion."
 9688: 
 9689: "Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public
 9690: prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this
 9691: article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride."
 9692: 
 9693: Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it
 9694: goes."
 9695: 
 9696: "But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could
 9697: offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most
 9698: directly by questioning you."
 9699: 
 9700: "Pray do so."
 9701: 
 9702: "When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"
 9703: 
 9704: "In San Francisco, a year ago."
 9705: 
 9706: "You were travelling in the States?"
 9707: 
 9708: "Yes."
 9709: 
 9710: "Did you become engaged then?"
 9711: 
 9712: "No."
 9713: 
 9714: "But you were on a friendly footing?"
 9715: 
 9716: "I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was
 9717: amused."
 9718: 
 9719: "Her father is very rich?"
 9720: 
 9721: "He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."
 9722: 
 9723: "And how did he make his money?"
 9724: 
 9725: "In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,
 9726: invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."
 9727: 
 9728: "Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your
 9729: wife's character?"
 9730: 
 9731: The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down
 9732: into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was
 9733: twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she
 9734: ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or
 9735: mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than
 9736: from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy,
 9737: with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of
 9738: traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She
 9739: is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
 9740: resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the
 9741: name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately
 9742: cough--"had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I
 9743: believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that
 9744: anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."
 9745: 
 9746: "Have you her photograph?"
 9747: 
 9748: "I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the
 9749: full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an
 9750: ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect
 9751: of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the
 9752: exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he
 9753: closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.
 9754: 
 9755: "The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your
 9756: acquaintance?"
 9757: 
 9758: "Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I
 9759: met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now
 9760: married her."
 9761: 
 9762: "She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?"
 9763: 
 9764: "A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."
 9765: 
 9766: "And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a
 9767: fait accompli?"
 9768: 
 9769: "I really have made no inquiries on the subject."
 9770: 
 9771: "Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the
 9772: wedding?"
 9773: 
 9774: "Yes."
 9775: 
 9776: "Was she in good spirits?"
 9777: 
 9778: "Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our
 9779: future lives."
 9780: 
 9781: "Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the
 9782: wedding?"
 9783: 
 9784: "She was as bright as possible--at least until after the
 9785: ceremony."
 9786: 
 9787: "And did you observe any change in her then?"
 9788: 
 9789: "Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had
 9790: ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident
 9791: however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible
 9792: bearing upon the case."
 9793: 
 9794: "Pray let us have it, for all that."
 9795: 
 9796: "Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards
 9797: the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it
 9798: fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the
 9799: gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not
 9800: appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of
 9801: the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our
 9802: way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."
 9803: 
 9804: "Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of
 9805: the general public were present, then?"
 9806: 
 9807: "Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is
 9808: open."
 9809: 
 9810: "This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"
 9811: 
 9812: "No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
 9813: common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But
 9814: really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."
 9815: 
 9816: "Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less
 9817: cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do
 9818: on re-entering her father's house?"
 9819: 
 9820: "I saw her in conversation with her maid."
 9821: 
 9822: "And who is her maid?"
 9823: 
 9824: "Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California
 9825: with her."
 9826: 
 9827: "A confidential servant?"
 9828: 
 9829: "A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed
 9830: her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they
 9831: look upon these things in a different way."
 9832: 
 9833: "How long did she speak to this Alice?"
 9834: 
 9835: "Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of."
 9836: 
 9837: "You did not overhear what they said?"
 9838: 
 9839: "Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was
 9840: accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she
 9841: meant."
 9842: 
 9843: "American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your
 9844: wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"
 9845: 
 9846: "She walked into the breakfast-room."
 9847: 
 9848: "On your arm?"
 9849: 
 9850: "No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.
 9851: Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose
 9852: hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She
 9853: never came back."
 9854: 
 9855: "But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to
 9856: her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a
 9857: bonnet, and went out."
 9858: 
 9859: "Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in
 9860: company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who
 9861: had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that
 9862: morning."
 9863: 
 9864: "Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady,
 9865: and your relations to her."
 9866: 
 9867: Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.
 9868: "We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on
 9869: a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have
 9870: not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of
 9871: complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.
 9872: Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and
 9873: devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she
 9874: heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the
 9875: reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I
 9876: feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to
 9877: Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to
 9878: push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my
 9879: wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the
 9880: possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police
 9881: fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.
 9882: She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a
 9883: row."
 9884: 
 9885: "Did your wife hear all this?"
 9886: 
 9887: "No, thank goodness, she did not."
 9888: 
 9889: "And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"
 9890: 
 9891: "Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as
 9892: so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid
 9893: some terrible trap for her."
 9894: 
 9895: "Well, it is a possible supposition."
 9896: 
 9897: "You think so, too?"
 9898: 
 9899: "I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon
 9900: this as likely?"
 9901: 
 9902: "I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."
 9903: 
 9904: "Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray
 9905: what is your own theory as to what took place?"
 9906: 
 9907: "Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I
 9908: have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may
 9909: say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of
 9910: this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a
 9911: social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous
 9912: disturbance in my wife."
 9913: 
 9914: "In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"
 9915: 
 9916: "Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I
 9917: will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to
 9918: without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."
 9919: 
 9920: "Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said
 9921: Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have
 9922: nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the
 9923: breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"
 9924: 
 9925: "We could see the other side of the road and the Park."
 9926: 
 9927: "Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.
 9928: I shall communicate with you."
 9929: 
 9930: "Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our
 9931: client, rising.
 9932: 
 9933: "I have solved it."
 9934: 
 9935: "Eh? What was that?"
 9936: 
 9937: "I say that I have solved it."
 9938: 
 9939: "Where, then, is my wife?"
 9940: 
 9941: "That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."
 9942: 
 9943: Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take
 9944: wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a
 9945: stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.
 9946: 
 9947: "It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting
 9948: it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I
 9949: think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all
 9950: this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the
 9951: case before our client came into the room."
 9952: 
 9953: "My dear Holmes!"
 9954: 
 9955: "I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I
 9956: remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination
 9957: served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial
 9958: evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a
 9959: trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."
 9960: 
 9961: "But I have heard all that you have heard."
 9962: 
 9963: "Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which
 9964: serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some
 9965: years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich
 9966: the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these
 9967: cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!
 9968: You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are
 9969: cigars in the box."
 9970: 
 9971: The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,
 9972: which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a
 9973: black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated
 9974: himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.
 9975: 
 9976: "What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You
 9977: look dissatisfied."
 9978: 
 9979: "And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage
 9980: case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."
 9981: 
 9982: "Really! You surprise me."
 9983: 
 9984: "Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip
 9985: through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."
 9986: 
 9987: "And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his
 9988: hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.
 9989: 
 9990: "Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."
 9991: 
 9992: "In heaven's name, what for?"
 9993: 
 9994: "In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."
 9995: 
 9996: Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
 9997: 
 9998: "Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he
 9999: asked.
10000: 
10001: "Why? What do you mean?"
10002: 
10003: "Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in
10004: the one as in the other."
10005: 
10006: Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you
10007: know all about it," he snarled.
10008: 
10009: "Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."
10010: 
10011: "Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in
10012: the matter?"
10013: 
10014: "I think it very unlikely."
10015: 
10016: "Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found
10017: this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the
10018: floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin
10019: shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked
10020: in water. "There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the
10021: top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master
10022: Holmes."
10023: 
10024: "Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.
10025: "You dragged them from the Serpentine?"
10026: 
10027: "No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.
10028: They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me
10029: that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."
10030: 
10031: "By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found
10032: in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope
10033: to arrive at through this?"
10034: 
10035: "At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance."
10036: 
10037: "I am afraid that you will find it difficult."
10038: 
10039: "Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I
10040: am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your
10041: deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as
10042: many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."
10043: 
10044: "And how?"
10045: 
10046: "In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the
10047: card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it
10048: down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will
10049: see me when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.' Now my theory all
10050: along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora
10051: Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was
10052: responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her
10053: initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped
10054: into her hand at the door and which lured her within their
10055: reach."
10056: 
10057: "Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are
10058: very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a
10059: listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he
10060: gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important,"
10061: said he.
10062: 
10063: "Ha! you find it so?"
10064: 
10065: "Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."
10066: 
10067: Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he
10068: shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"
10069: 
10070: "On the contrary, this is the right side."
10071: 
10072: "The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil
10073: over here."
10074: 
10075: "And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel
10076: bill, which interests me deeply."
10077: 
10078: "There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade.
10079: "'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s.
10080: 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."
10081: 
10082: "Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the
10083: note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I
10084: congratulate you again."
10085: 
10086: "I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in
10087: hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.
10088: Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom
10089: of the matter first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them
10090: into the bag, and made for the door.
10091: 
10092: "Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival
10093: vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady
10094: St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any
10095: such person."
10096: 
10097: Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me,
10098: tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and
10099: hurried away.
10100: 
10101: He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on
10102: his overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about
10103: outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must
10104: leave you to your papers for a little."
10105: 
10106: It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had
10107: no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a
10108: confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked
10109: with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and
10110: presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean
10111: little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble
10112: lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold
10113: woodcock, a pheasant, a pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras pie with a group of
10114: ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries,
10115: my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian
10116: Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid
10117: for and were ordered to this address.
10118: 
10119: Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the
10120: room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his
10121: eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his
10122: conclusions.
10123: 
10124: "They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.
10125: 
10126: "You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."
10127: 
10128: "Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I
10129: am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I
10130: fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."
10131: 
10132: It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,
10133: dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very
10134: perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
10135: 
10136: "My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.
10137: 
10138: "Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.
10139: Have you good authority for what you say?"
10140: 
10141: "The best possible."
10142: 
10143: Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his
10144: forehead.
10145: 
10146: "What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of
10147: the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"
10148: 
10149: "It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any
10150: humiliation."
10151: 
10152: "Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."
10153: 
10154: "I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the
10155: lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of
10156: doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she
10157: had no one to advise her at such a crisis."
10158: 
10159: "It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon,
10160: tapping his fingers upon the table.
10161: 
10162: "You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so
10163: unprecedented a position."
10164: 
10165: "I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have
10166: been shamefully used."
10167: 
10168: "I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps
10169: on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view
10170: of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here
10171: who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a
10172: lady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to
10173: introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I
10174: think, you have already met."
10175: 
10176: At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his
10177: seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand
10178: thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended
10179: dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out
10180: her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was
10181: as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was
10182: one which it was hard to resist.
10183: 
10184: "You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every
10185: cause to be."
10186: 
10187: "Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.
10188: 
10189: "Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I
10190: should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of
10191: rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just
10192: didn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't
10193: fall down and do a faint right there before the altar."
10194: 
10195: "Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave
10196: the room while you explain this matter?"
10197: 
10198: "If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman,
10199: "we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business
10200: already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to
10201: hear the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,
10202: clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.
10203: 
10204: "Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here
10205: and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where pa
10206: was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;
10207: but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile,
10208: while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to
10209: nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa
10210: wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took
10211: me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so
10212: he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything
10213: about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just
10214: fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and
10215: make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had
10216: as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of
10217: time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.
10218: 'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and
10219: then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your
10220: husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had
10221: fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting,
10222: that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek
10223: his fortune, and I went back to pa.
10224: 
10225: "The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then
10226: he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New
10227: Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a
10228: miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was
10229: my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was
10230: very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took
10231: me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a
10232: year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really
10233: dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London,
10234: and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt
10235: all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
10236: in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.
10237: 
10238: "Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done
10239: my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our
10240: actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make
10241: him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may
10242: imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I
10243: glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the
10244: first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked
10245: again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as
10246: if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I
10247: didn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the
10248: words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my
10249: ear. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and make
10250: a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to
10251: know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to
10252: tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,
10253: and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on
10254: the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the
10255: note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a
10256: line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.
10257: Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now
10258: to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.
10259: 
10260: "When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California,
10261: and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but
10262: to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to
10263: have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before
10264: his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to
10265: run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten
10266: minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of
10267: the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.
10268: I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman
10269: came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to
10270: me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little
10271: secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away
10272: from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and
10273: away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and
10274: that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank
10275: had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to
10276: 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to
10277: England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the
10278: very morning of my second wedding."
10279: 
10280: "I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name
10281: and the church but not where the lady lived."
10282: 
10283: "Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all
10284: for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I
10285: should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just
10286: sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It
10287: was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting
10288: round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So
10289: Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of
10290: them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away
10291: somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we
10292: should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good
10293: gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how
10294: he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very
10295: clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and
10296: that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so
10297: secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord
10298: St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at
10299: once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if
10300: I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very
10301: meanly of me."
10302: 
10303: Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but
10304: had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this
10305: long narrative.
10306: 
10307: "Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most
10308: intimate personal affairs in this public manner."
10309: 
10310: "Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"
10311: 
10312: "Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out
10313: his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.
10314: 
10315: "I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us
10316: in a friendly supper."
10317: 
10318: "I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his
10319: Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent
10320: developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over
10321: them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a
10322: very good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and
10323: stalked out of the room.
10324: 
10325: "Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your
10326: company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an
10327: American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the
10328: folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone
10329: years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens
10330: of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a
10331: quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."
10332: 
10333: "The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our
10334: visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how
10335: simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight
10336: seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural
10337: than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing
10338: stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.
10339: Lestrade of Scotland Yard."
10340: 
10341: "You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"
10342: 
10343: "From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that
10344: the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,
10345: the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of
10346: returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the
10347: morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that
10348: something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was
10349: out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she
10350: seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America
10351: because she had spent so short a time in this country that she
10352: could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence
10353: over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change
10354: her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a
10355: process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an
10356: American. Then who could this American be, and why should he
10357: possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might
10358: be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in
10359: rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got
10360: before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us
10361: of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so
10362: transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a
10363: bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very
10364: significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance
10365: means taking possession of that which another person has a prior
10366: claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had
10367: gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a
10368: previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."
10369: 
10370: "And how in the world did you find them?"
10371: 
10372: "It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held
10373: information in his hands the value of which he did not himself
10374: know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance,
10375: but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had
10376: settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."
10377: 
10378: "How did you deduce the select?"
10379: 
10380: "By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence
10381: for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive
10382: hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate.
10383: In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I
10384: learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an
10385: American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking
10386: over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I
10387: had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded
10388: to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate
10389: enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them
10390: some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
10391: better in every way that they should make their position a little
10392: clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in
10393: particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I
10394: made him keep the appointment."
10395: 
10396: "But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was
10397: certainly not very gracious."
10398: 
10399: "Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be
10400: very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and
10401: wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of
10402: fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully
10403: and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in
10404: the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for
10405: the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away
10406: these bleak autumnal evenings."
10407: 
10408: 
10409: 
10410: XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
10411: 
10412: "Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking
10413: down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather
10414: sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."
10415: 
10416: My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands
10417: in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It
10418: was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day
10419: before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the
10420: wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed
10421: into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and
10422: on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as
10423: when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but
10424: was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer
10425: passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the
10426: Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
10427: whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
10428: 
10429: He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a
10430: massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was
10431: dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining
10432: hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet
10433: his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
10434: and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little
10435: springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to
10436: set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and
10437: down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most
10438: extraordinary contortions.
10439: 
10440: "What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is
10441: looking up at the numbers of the houses."
10442: 
10443: "I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his
10444: hands.
10445: 
10446: "Here?"
10447: 
10448: "Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I
10449: think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As
10450: he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and
10451: pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the
10452: clanging.
10453: 
10454: A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still
10455: gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in
10456: his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and
10457: pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his
10458: body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the
10459: extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his
10460: feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we
10461: both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room.
10462: Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting
10463: beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy,
10464: soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
10465: 
10466: "You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he.
10467: "You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have
10468: recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into
10469: any little problem which you may submit to me."
10470: 
10471: The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting
10472: against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his
10473: brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.
10474: 
10475: "No doubt you think me mad?" said he.
10476: 
10477: "I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.
10478: 
10479: "God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my
10480: reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might
10481: have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet
10482: borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man;
10483: but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have
10484: been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone.
10485: The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found
10486: out of this horrible affair."
10487: 
10488: "Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a
10489: clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen
10490: you."
10491: 
10492: "My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your
10493: ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &
10494: Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."
10495: 
10496: The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior
10497: partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City
10498: of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the
10499: foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We
10500: waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced
10501: himself to tell his story.
10502: 
10503: "I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened
10504: here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure
10505: your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and
10506: hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this
10507: snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who
10508: takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the
10509: facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.
10510: 
10511: "It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking
10512: business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
10513: investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
10514: and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means
10515: of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security
10516: is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction
10517: during the last few years, and there are many noble families to
10518: whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their
10519: pictures, libraries, or plate.
10520: 
10521: "Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a
10522: card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I
10523: saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps
10524: even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name
10525: which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest,
10526: noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the
10527: honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged
10528: at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry
10529: quickly through a disagreeable task.
10530: 
10531: "'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the
10532: habit of advancing money.'
10533: 
10534: "'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.
10535: 
10536: "'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have
10537: 50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a
10538: sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it
10539: a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my
10540: position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place
10541: one's self under obligations.'
10542: 
10543: "'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.
10544: 
10545: "'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most
10546: certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you
10547: think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the
10548: money should be paid at once.'
10549: 
10550: "'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my
10551: own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be
10552: rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do
10553: it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must
10554: insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution
10555: should be taken.'
10556: 
10557: "'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a
10558: square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair.
10559: 'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'
10560: 
10561: "'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,'
10562: said I.
10563: 
10564: "'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,
10565: flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery
10566: which he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said
10567: he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The
10568: lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the
10569: sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my
10570: security.'
10571: 
10572: "I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some
10573: perplexity from it to my illustrious client.
10574: 
10575: "'You doubt its value?' he asked.
10576: 
10577: "'Not at all. I only doubt--'
10578: 
10579: "'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest
10580: about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely
10581: certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a
10582: pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'
10583: 
10584: "'Ample.'
10585: 
10586: "'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof
10587: of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I
10588: have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to
10589: refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to
10590: preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I
10591: need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any
10592: harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as
10593: serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the
10594: world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.
10595: I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall
10596: call for it in person on Monday morning.'
10597: 
10598: "Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,
10599: calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000
10600: pound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the
10601: precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not
10602: but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
10603: which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it
10604: was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any
10605: misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever
10606: consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter
10607: the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned
10608: once more to my work.
10609: 
10610: "When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave
10611: so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had
10612: been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how
10613: terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I
10614: determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always
10615: carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might
10616: never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a
10617: cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel
10618: with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs
10619: and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.
10620: 
10621: "And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to
10622: thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep
10623: out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three
10624: maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose
10625: absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy
10626: Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few
10627: months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has
10628: always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has
10629: attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.
10630: That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we
10631: believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
10632: 
10633: "So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it
10634: will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an
10635: only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr.
10636: Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am
10637: myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very
10638: likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I
10639: had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a
10640: moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it
10641: would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I
10642: meant it for the best.
10643: 
10644: "It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
10645: business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild,
10646: wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the
10647: handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a
10648: member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming
10649: manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long
10650: purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards
10651: and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again
10652: to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
10653: allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried
10654: more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he
10655: was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir
10656: George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.
10657: 
10658: "And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George
10659: Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently
10660: brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could
10661: hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than
10662: Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been
10663: everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of
10664: great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far
10665: away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his
10666: cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that
10667: he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,
10668: too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into
10669: character.
10670: 
10671: "And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but
10672: when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the
10673: world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my
10674: daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful,
10675: a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and
10676: gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know
10677: what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone
10678: against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for
10679: he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I
10680: think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it
10681: would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his
10682: whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!
10683: 
10684: "Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and
10685: I shall continue with my miserable story.
10686: 
10687: "When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after
10688: dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious
10689: treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name
10690: of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am
10691: sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.
10692: Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous
10693: coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.
10694: 
10695: "'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.
10696: 
10697: "'In my own bureau.'
10698: 
10699: "'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the
10700: night.' said he.
10701: 
10702: "'It is locked up,' I answered.
10703: 
10704: "'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I
10705: have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'
10706: 
10707: "He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of
10708: what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with
10709: a very grave face.
10710: 
10711: "'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let
10712: me have 200 pounds?'
10713: 
10714: "'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too
10715: generous with you in money matters.'
10716: 
10717: "'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money,
10718: or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'
10719: 
10720: "'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.
10721: 
10722: "'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,'
10723: said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money
10724: in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try
10725: other means.'
10726: 
10727: "I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the
10728: month. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which
10729: he bowed and left the room without another word.
10730: 
10731: "When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my
10732: treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go
10733: round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I
10734: usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform
10735: myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself
10736: at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as
10737: I approached.
10738: 
10739: "'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little
10740: disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out
10741: to-night?'
10742: 
10743: "'Certainly not.'
10744: 
10745: "'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she
10746: has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that
10747: it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'
10748: 
10749: "'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer
10750: it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'
10751: 
10752: "'Quite sure, dad.'
10753: 
10754: "'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom
10755: again, where I was soon asleep.
10756: 
10757: "I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may
10758: have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question
10759: me upon any point which I do not make clear."
10760: 
10761: "On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."
10762: 
10763: "I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be
10764: particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety
10765: in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.
10766: About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in
10767: the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an
10768: impression behind it as though a window had gently closed
10769: somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my
10770: horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in
10771: the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,
10772: and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.
10773: 
10774: "'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you
10775: touch that coronet?'
10776: 
10777: "The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,
10778: dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the
10779: light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be
10780: wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry
10781: he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I
10782: snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with
10783: three of the beryls in it, was missing.
10784: 
10785: "'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have
10786: destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the
10787: jewels which you have stolen?'
10788: 
10789: "'Stolen!' he cried.
10790: 
10791: "'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
10792: 
10793: "'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.
10794: 
10795: "'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I
10796: call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to
10797: tear off another piece?'
10798: 
10799: "'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it
10800: any longer. I shall not say another word about this business,
10801: since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in
10802: the morning and make my own way in the world.'
10803: 
10804: "'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried
10805: half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to
10806: the bottom.'
10807: 
10808: "'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such
10809: as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to
10810: call the police, let the police find what they can.'
10811: 
10812: "By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my
10813: voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and,
10814: at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the
10815: whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the
10816: ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the
10817: investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a
10818: constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with
10819: his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge
10820: him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private
10821: matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was
10822: national property. I was determined that the law should have its
10823: way in everything.
10824: 
10825: "'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It
10826: would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the
10827: house for five minutes.'
10828: 
10829: "'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you
10830: have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position
10831: in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only
10832: my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at
10833: stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would
10834: convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell
10835: me what he had done with the three missing stones.
10836: 
10837: "'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught
10838: in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.
10839: If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling
10840: us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'
10841: 
10842: "'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered,
10843: turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened
10844: for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for
10845: it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search
10846: was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of
10847: every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed
10848: the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the
10849: wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our
10850: threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after
10851: going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to
10852: you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.
10853: The police have openly confessed that they can at present make
10854: nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think
10855: necessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My
10856: God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son
10857: in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"
10858: 
10859: He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to
10860: and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got
10861: beyond words.
10862: 
10863: Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows
10864: knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
10865: 
10866: "Do you receive much company?" he asked.
10867: 
10868: "None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of
10869: Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No
10870: one else, I think."
10871: 
10872: "Do you go out much in society?"
10873: 
10874: "Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for
10875: it."
10876: 
10877: "That is unusual in a young girl."
10878: 
10879: "She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She
10880: is four-and-twenty."
10881: 
10882: "This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to
10883: her also."
10884: 
10885: "Terrible! She is even more affected than I."
10886: 
10887: "You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"
10888: 
10889: "How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet
10890: in his hands."
10891: 
10892: "I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of
10893: the coronet at all injured?"
10894: 
10895: "Yes, it was twisted."
10896: 
10897: "Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to
10898: straighten it?"
10899: 
10900: "God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me.
10901: But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If
10902: his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"
10903: 
10904: "Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?
10905: His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several
10906: singular points about the case. What did the police think of the
10907: noise which awoke you from your sleep?"
10908: 
10909: "They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his
10910: bedroom door."
10911: 
10912: "A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door
10913: so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the
10914: disappearance of these gems?"
10915: 
10916: "They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture
10917: in the hope of finding them."
10918: 
10919: "Have they thought of looking outside the house?"
10920: 
10921: "Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has
10922: already been minutely examined."
10923: 
10924: "Now, my dear sir," said Holmes, "is it not obvious to you now
10925: that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you
10926: or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you
10927: to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider
10928: what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came
10929: down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,
10930: opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main
10931: force a small portion of it, went off to some other place,
10932: concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that
10933: nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six
10934: into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger
10935: of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"
10936: 
10937: "But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of
10938: despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain
10939: them?"
10940: 
10941: "It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if
10942: you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together,
10943: and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into
10944: details."
10945: 
10946: My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,
10947: which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy
10948: were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I
10949: confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be
10950: as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such
10951: faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some
10952: grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted
10953: explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the
10954: southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his
10955: hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client
10956: appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
10957: which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a
10958: desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway
10959: journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest
10960: residence of the great financier.
10961: 
10962: Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing
10963: back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a
10964: snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates
10965: which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden
10966: thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges
10967: stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the
10968: tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the
10969: stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a
10970: public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing
10971: at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the
10972: front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden
10973: behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I
10974: went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should
10975: return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and
10976: a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height,
10977: slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against
10978: the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever
10979: seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were
10980: bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept
10981: silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of
10982: grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the
10983: more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong
10984: character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding
10985: my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand
10986: over his head with a sweet womanly caress.
10987: 
10988: "You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you
10989: not, dad?" she asked.
10990: 
10991: "No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."
10992: 
10993: "But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's
10994: instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will
10995: be sorry for having acted so harshly."
10996: 
10997: "Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"
10998: 
10999: "Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should
11000: suspect him."
11001: 
11002: "How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with
11003: the coronet in his hand?"
11004: 
11005: "Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take
11006: my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say
11007: no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in
11008: prison!"
11009: 
11010: "I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary!
11011: Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences
11012: to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman
11013: down from London to inquire more deeply into it."
11014: 
11015: "This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.
11016: 
11017: "No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in
11018: the stable lane now."
11019: 
11020: "The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he
11021: hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir,
11022: that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth,
11023: that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."
11024: 
11025: "I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may
11026: prove it," returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the
11027: snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing
11028: Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"
11029: 
11030: "Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."
11031: 
11032: "You heard nothing yourself last night?"
11033: 
11034: "Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard
11035: that, and I came down."
11036: 
11037: "You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you
11038: fasten all the windows?"
11039: 
11040: "Yes."
11041: 
11042: "Were they all fastened this morning?"
11043: 
11044: "Yes."
11045: 
11046: "You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked
11047: to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"
11048: 
11049: "Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and
11050: who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet."
11051: 
11052: "I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her
11053: sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery."
11054: 
11055: "But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the
11056: banker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur with
11057: the coronet in his hands?"
11058: 
11059: "Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this
11060: girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I
11061: presume?"
11062: 
11063: "Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I
11064: met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."
11065: 
11066: "Do you know him?"
11067: 
11068: "Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.
11069: His name is Francis Prosper."
11070: 
11071: "He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to
11072: say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"
11073: 
11074: "Yes, he did."
11075: 
11076: "And he is a man with a wooden leg?"
11077: 
11078: Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive
11079: black eyes. "Why, you are like a magician," said she. "How do you
11080: know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in
11081: Holmes' thin, eager face.
11082: 
11083: "I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall
11084: probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps
11085: I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."
11086: 
11087: He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at
11088: the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.
11089: This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill
11090: with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs,"
11091: said he at last.
11092: 
11093: The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little
11094: chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.
11095: Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.
11096: 
11097: "Which key was used to open it?" he asked.
11098: 
11099: "That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the
11100: lumber-room."
11101: 
11102: "Have you it here?"
11103: 
11104: "That is it on the dressing-table."
11105: 
11106: Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.
11107: 
11108: "It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did
11109: not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must
11110: have a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem
11111: he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the
11112: jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I
11113: have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge,
11114: where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.
11115: 
11116: "Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which
11117: corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I
11118: beg that you will break it off."
11119: 
11120: The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying,"
11121: said he.
11122: 
11123: "Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but
11124: without result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though
11125: I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my
11126: time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do
11127: you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would
11128: be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this
11129: happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard
11130: nothing of it?"
11131: 
11132: "I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."
11133: 
11134: "But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think,
11135: Miss Holder?"
11136: 
11137: "I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."
11138: 
11139: "Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"
11140: 
11141: "He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."
11142: 
11143: "Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary
11144: luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault
11145: if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your
11146: permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations
11147: outside."
11148: 
11149: He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any
11150: unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an
11151: hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet
11152: heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.
11153: 
11154: "I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.
11155: Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my
11156: rooms."
11157: 
11158: "But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"
11159: 
11160: "I cannot tell."
11161: 
11162: The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he
11163: cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"
11164: 
11165: "My opinion is in no way altered."
11166: 
11167: "Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was
11168: acted in my house last night?"
11169: 
11170: "If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow
11171: morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to
11172: make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to
11173: act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you
11174: place no limit on the sum I may draw."
11175: 
11176: "I would give my fortune to have them back."
11177: 
11178: "Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.
11179: Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here
11180: again before evening."
11181: 
11182: It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up
11183: about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than
11184: I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward
11185: journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always
11186: glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in
11187: despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our
11188: rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in
11189: a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned
11190: up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he
11191: was a perfect sample of the class.
11192: 
11193: "I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass
11194: above the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me,
11195: Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in
11196: this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I
11197: shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few
11198: hours." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard,
11199: sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this
11200: rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.
11201: 
11202: I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in
11203: excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his
11204: hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a
11205: cup of tea.
11206: 
11207: "I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."
11208: 
11209: "Where to?"
11210: 
11211: "Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time
11212: before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be
11213: late."
11214: 
11215: "How are you getting on?"
11216: 
11217: "Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham
11218: since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a
11219: very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a
11220: good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get
11221: these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly
11222: respectable self."
11223: 
11224: I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for
11225: satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled,
11226: and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He
11227: hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of
11228: the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his
11229: congenial hunt.
11230: 
11231: I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so
11232: I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away
11233: for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that
11234: his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he
11235: came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there
11236: he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the
11237: other, as fresh and trim as possible.
11238: 
11239: "You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but
11240: you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this
11241: morning."
11242: 
11243: "Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be
11244: surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."
11245: 
11246: It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the
11247: change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally
11248: of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in,
11249: while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered
11250: with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than
11251: his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into
11252: the armchair which I pushed forward for him.
11253: 
11254: "I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said
11255: he. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without
11256: a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured
11257: age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece,
11258: Mary, has deserted me."
11259: 
11260: "Deserted you?"
11261: 
11262: "Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was
11263: empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to
11264: her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had
11265: married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was
11266: thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers
11267: in this note:
11268: 
11269: "'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,
11270: and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune
11271: might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my
11272: mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must
11273: leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is
11274: provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will
11275: be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in
11276: death, I am ever your loving,--MARY.'
11277: 
11278: "What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it
11279: points to suicide?"
11280: 
11281: "No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible
11282: solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of
11283: your troubles."
11284: 
11285: "Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have
11286: learned something! Where are the gems?"
11287: 
11288: "You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for
11289: them?"
11290: 
11291: "I would pay ten."
11292: 
11293: "That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter.
11294: And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book?
11295: Here is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds."
11296: 
11297: With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes
11298: walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of
11299: gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
11300: 
11301: With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
11302: 
11303: "You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"
11304: 
11305: The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and
11306: he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.
11307: 
11308: "There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock
11309: Holmes rather sternly.
11310: 
11311: "Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."
11312: 
11313: "No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that
11314: noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I
11315: should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to
11316: have one."
11317: 
11318: "Then it was not Arthur who took them?"
11319: 
11320: "I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."
11321: 
11322: "You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him
11323: know that the truth is known."
11324: 
11325: "He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an
11326: interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the
11327: story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was
11328: right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite
11329: clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his
11330: lips."
11331: 
11332: "For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary
11333: mystery!"
11334: 
11335: "I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached
11336: it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me
11337: to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding
11338: between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now
11339: fled together."
11340: 
11341: "My Mary? Impossible!"
11342: 
11343: "It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither
11344: you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you
11345: admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most
11346: dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely
11347: desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece
11348: knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he
11349: had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she
11350: alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said,
11351: but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing
11352: him nearly every evening."
11353: 
11354: "I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an
11355: ashen face.
11356: 
11357: "I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.
11358: Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room,
11359: slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which
11360: leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right
11361: through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the
11362: coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he
11363: bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but
11364: there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all
11365: other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had
11366: hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
11367: downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you
11368: about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover,
11369: which was all perfectly true.
11370: 
11371: "Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but
11372: he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.
11373: In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door,
11374: so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin
11375: walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared
11376: into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad
11377: slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what
11378: would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the
11379: room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw
11380: that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed
11381: down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and
11382: slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see
11383: what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the
11384: window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then
11385: closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close
11386: to where he stood hid behind the curtain.
11387: 
11388: "As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action
11389: without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the
11390: instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune
11391: this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it
11392: right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened
11393: the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,
11394: where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George
11395: Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was
11396: a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the
11397: coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son
11398: struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something
11399: suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet
11400: in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your
11401: room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in
11402: the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you
11403: appeared upon the scene."
11404: 
11405: "Is it possible?" gasped the banker.
11406: 
11407: "You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when
11408: he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not
11409: explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who
11410: certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He
11411: took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her
11412: secret."
11413: 
11414: "And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the
11415: coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have
11416: been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!
11417: The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the
11418: scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"
11419: 
11420: "When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went
11421: very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in
11422: the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since
11423: the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost
11424: to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but
11425: found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,
11426: however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood
11427: and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed
11428: that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been
11429: disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was
11430: shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had
11431: waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time
11432: that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had
11433: already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed
11434: round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,
11435: which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable
11436: lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in
11437: front of me.
11438: 
11439: "There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second
11440: double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked
11441: feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the
11442: latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the
11443: other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over
11444: the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed
11445: after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the
11446: hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while
11447: waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred
11448: yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round,
11449: where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,
11450: and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me
11451: that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and
11452: another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been
11453: hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that
11454: the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.
11455: 
11456: "On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the
11457: sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could
11458: at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the
11459: outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming
11460: in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what
11461: had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had
11462: brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had
11463: pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged
11464: at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which
11465: neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the
11466: prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So
11467: far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who
11468: was it brought him the coronet?
11469: 
11470: "It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
11471: impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
11472: truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down,
11473: so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were
11474: the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in
11475: their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his
11476: cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should
11477: retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful
11478: one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and
11479: how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture
11480: became a certainty.
11481: 
11482: "And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently,
11483: for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must
11484: feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your
11485: circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir
11486: George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil
11487: reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots
11488: and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur
11489: had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was
11490: safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his
11491: own family.
11492: 
11493: "Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took
11494: next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house,
11495: managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that
11496: his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at
11497: the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of
11498: his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and
11499: saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."
11500: 
11501: "I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,"
11502: said Mr. Holder.
11503: 
11504: "Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home
11505: and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to
11506: play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert
11507: scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our
11508: hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of
11509: course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every
11510: particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a
11511: life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I
11512: clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he
11513: became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give
11514: him a price for the stones he held--1000 pounds apiece. That
11515: brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why,
11516: dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the
11517: three!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had
11518: them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I
11519: set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000
11520: pounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all
11521: was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after
11522: what I may call a really hard day's work."
11523: 
11524: "A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said
11525: the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but
11526: you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your
11527: skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I
11528: must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I
11529: have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my
11530: very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."
11531: 
11532: "I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is
11533: wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that
11534: whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than
11535: sufficient punishment."
11536: 
11537: 
11538: 
11539: XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
11540: 
11541: "To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock
11542: Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily
11543: Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest
11544: manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is
11545: pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped
11546: this truth that in these little records of our cases which you
11547: have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,
11548: occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much
11549: to the many causes cÃ©lÃ¨bres and sensational trials in which I
11550: have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
11551: trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those
11552: faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made
11553: my special province."
11554: 
11555: "And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved
11556: from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my
11557: records."
11558: 
11559: "You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing
11560: cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood
11561: pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a
11562: disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred
11563: perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your
11564: statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing
11565: upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is
11566: really the only notable feature about the thing."
11567: 
11568: "It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,"
11569: I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism
11570: which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my
11571: friend's singular character.
11572: 
11573: "No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as
11574: was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full
11575: justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a
11576: thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it
11577: is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should
11578: dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of
11579: lectures into a series of tales."
11580: 
11581: It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after
11582: breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at
11583: Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of
11584: dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark,
11585: shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit
11586: and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for
11587: the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been
11588: silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the
11589: advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,
11590: having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very
11591: sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
11592: 
11593: "At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he
11594: had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire,
11595: "you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of
11596: these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself
11597: in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense,
11598: at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King
11599: of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the
11600: problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the
11601: incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are
11602: outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I
11603: fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."
11604: 
11605: "The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold
11606: to have been novel and of interest."
11607: 
11608: "Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant
11609: public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a
11610: compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of
11611: analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot
11612: blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at
11613: least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As
11614: to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an
11615: agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to
11616: young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched
11617: bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my
11618: zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across
11619: to me.
11620: 
11621: It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and
11622: ran thus:
11623: 
11624: "DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether
11625: I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered
11626: to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I
11627: do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,
11628:                                                "VIOLET HUNTER."
11629: 
11630: "Do you know the young lady?" I asked.
11631: 
11632: "Not I."
11633: 
11634: "It is half-past ten now."
11635: 
11636: "Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."
11637: 
11638: "It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You
11639: remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to
11640: be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation.
11641: It may be so in this case, also."
11642: 
11643: "Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved,
11644: for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question."
11645: 
11646: As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.
11647: She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face,
11648: freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a
11649: woman who has had her own way to make in the world.
11650: 
11651: "You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my
11652: companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange
11653: experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort
11654: from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be
11655: kind enough to tell me what I should do."
11656: 
11657: "Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything
11658: that I can to serve you."
11659: 
11660: I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner
11661: and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching
11662: fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and
11663: his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.
11664: 
11665: "I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the
11666: family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel
11667: received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his
11668: children over to America with him, so that I found myself without
11669: a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but
11670: without success. At last the little money which I had saved began
11671: to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.
11672: 
11673: "There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End
11674: called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in
11675: order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.
11676: Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is
11677: really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office,
11678: and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom,
11679: and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers
11680: and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.
11681: 
11682: "Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office
11683: as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A
11684: prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy
11685: chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at
11686: her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very
11687: earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a
11688: jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.
11689: 
11690: "'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better.
11691: Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his
11692: hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a
11693: comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at
11694: him.
11695: 
11696: "'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.
11697: 
11698: "'Yes, sir.'
11699: 
11700: "'As governess?'
11701: 
11702: "'Yes, sir.'
11703: 
11704: "'And what salary do you ask?'
11705: 
11706: "'I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence
11707: Munro.'
11708: 
11709: "'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his
11710: fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling
11711: passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with
11712: such attractions and accomplishments?'
11713: 
11714: "'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I.
11715: 'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--'
11716: 
11717: "'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question.
11718: The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment
11719: of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are
11720: not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a
11721: considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have
11722: why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to
11723: accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me,
11724: madam, would commence at 100 pounds a year.'
11725: 
11726: "You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was,
11727: such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman,
11728: however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face,
11729: opened a pocket-book and took out a note.
11730: 
11731: "'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant
11732: fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid
11733: the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies
11734: half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little
11735: expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'
11736: 
11737: "It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so
11738: thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the
11739: advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something
11740: unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know
11741: a little more before I quite committed myself.
11742: 
11743: "'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.
11744: 
11745: "'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles
11746: on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my
11747: dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'
11748: 
11749: "'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would
11750: be.'
11751: 
11752: "'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if
11753: you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack!
11754: smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back
11755: in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.
11756: 
11757: "I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement,
11758: but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was
11759: joking.
11760: 
11761: "'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single
11762: child?'
11763: 
11764: "'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he
11765: cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would
11766: suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided
11767: always that they were such commands as a lady might with
11768: propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'
11769: 
11770: "'I should be happy to make myself useful.'
11771: 
11772: "'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you
11773: know--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress
11774: which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.
11775: Heh?'
11776: 
11777: "'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.
11778: 
11779: "'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to
11780: you?'
11781: 
11782: "'Oh, no.'
11783: 
11784: "'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'
11785: 
11786: "I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes,
11787: my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of
11788: chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of
11789: sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.
11790: 
11791: "'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been
11792: watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a
11793: shadow pass over his face as I spoke.
11794: 
11795: "'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a
11796: little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam,
11797: ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your
11798: hair?'
11799: 
11800: "'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.
11801: 
11802: "'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a
11803: pity, because in other respects you would really have done very
11804: nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more
11805: of your young ladies.'
11806: 
11807: "The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers
11808: without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so
11809: much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting
11810: that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.
11811: 
11812: "'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.
11813: 
11814: "'If you please, Miss Stoper.'
11815: 
11816: "'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the
11817: most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You
11818: can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such
11819: opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong
11820: upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.
11821: 
11822: "Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found
11823: little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the
11824: table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very
11825: foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and
11826: expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were
11827: at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few
11828: governesses in England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides,
11829: what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing
11830: it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was
11831: inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after
11832: I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go
11833: back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open
11834: when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it
11835: here and I will read it to you:
11836: 
11837:                        "'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.
11838: "'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your
11839: address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have
11840: reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you
11841: should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of
11842: you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a
11843: year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which
11844: our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My
11845: wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would
11846: like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need
11847: not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one
11848: belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which
11849: would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting
11850: here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that
11851: need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no
11852: doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty
11853: during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain
11854: firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary
11855: may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child
11856: is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall
11857: meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train.
11858: Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'
11859: 
11860: "That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and
11861: my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however,
11862: that before taking the final step I should like to submit the
11863: whole matter to your consideration."
11864: 
11865: "Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the
11866: question," said Holmes, smiling.
11867: 
11868: "But you would not advise me to refuse?"
11869: 
11870: "I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to
11871: see a sister of mine apply for."
11872: 
11873: "What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"
11874: 
11875: "Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself
11876: formed some opinion?"
11877: 
11878: "Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr.
11879: Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not
11880: possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the
11881: matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that
11882: he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an
11883: outbreak?"
11884: 
11885: "That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is
11886: the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a
11887: nice household for a young lady."
11888: 
11889: "But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"
11890: 
11891: "Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what
11892: makes me uneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when
11893: they could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must be some
11894: strong reason behind."
11895: 
11896: "I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would
11897: understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so
11898: much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."
11899: 
11900: "Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that
11901: your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has
11902: come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel
11903: about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt
11904: or in danger--"
11905: 
11906: "Danger! What danger do you foresee?"
11907: 
11908: Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if
11909: we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a
11910: telegram would bring me down to your help."
11911: 
11912: "That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the
11913: anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire
11914: quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once,
11915: sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester
11916: to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both
11917: good-night and bustled off upon her way.
11918: 
11919: "At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending
11920: the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able
11921: to take care of herself."
11922: 
11923: "And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much
11924: mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."
11925: 
11926: It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled.
11927: A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts
11928: turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of
11929: human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual
11930: salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to
11931: something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether
11932: the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond
11933: my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat
11934: frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an
11935: abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his
11936: hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried
11937: impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would
11938: always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever
11939: have accepted such a situation.
11940: 
11941: The telegram which we eventually received came late one night
11942: just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down
11943: to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently
11944: indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a
11945: test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came
11946: down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope,
11947: and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.
11948: 
11949: "Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back
11950: to his chemical studies.
11951: 
11952: The summons was a brief and urgent one.
11953: 
11954: "Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday
11955: to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.  HUNTER."
11956: 
11957: "Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.
11958: 
11959: "I should wish to."
11960: 
11961: "Just look it up, then."
11962: 
11963: "There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my
11964: Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."
11965: 
11966: "That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my
11967: analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the
11968: morning."
11969: 
11970: By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the
11971: old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers
11972: all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he
11973: threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal
11974: spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white
11975: clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining
11976: very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air,
11977: which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside,
11978: away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and
11979: grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light
11980: green of the new foliage.
11981: 
11982: "Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the
11983: enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.
11984: 
11985: But Holmes shook his head gravely.
11986: 
11987: "Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of
11988: a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with
11989: reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered
11990: houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them,
11991: and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their
11992: isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed
11993: there."
11994: 
11995: "Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these
11996: dear old homesteads?"
11997: 
11998: "They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,
11999: Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest
12000: alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin
12001: than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."
12002: 
12003: "You horrify me!"
12004: 
12005: "But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion
12006: can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no
12007: lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of
12008: a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among
12009: the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever
12010: so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is
12011: but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these
12012: lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part
12013: with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the
12014: deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on,
12015: year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this
12016: lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I
12017: should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of
12018: country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is
12019: not personally threatened."
12020: 
12021: "No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."
12022: 
12023: "Quite so. She has her freedom."
12024: 
12025: "What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"
12026: 
12027: "I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would
12028: cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is
12029: correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we
12030: shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of
12031: the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has
12032: to tell."
12033: 
12034: The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no
12035: distance from the station, and there we found the young lady
12036: waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch
12037: awaited us upon the table.
12038: 
12039: "I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It
12040: is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I
12041: should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."
12042: 
12043: "Pray tell us what has happened to you."
12044: 
12045: "I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.
12046: Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into
12047: town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."
12048: 
12049: "Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long
12050: thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.
12051: 
12052: "In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole,
12053: with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is
12054: only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and
12055: I am not easy in my mind about them."
12056: 
12057: "What can you not understand?"
12058: 
12059: "Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just
12060: as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and
12061: drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he
12062: said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself,
12063: for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all
12064: stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds
12065: round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which
12066: slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about
12067: a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs
12068: to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord
12069: Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in
12070: front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
12071: 
12072: "I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever,
12073: and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.
12074: There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to
12075: us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is
12076: not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much
12077: younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think,
12078: while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their
12079: conversation I have gathered that they have been married about
12080: seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by
12081: the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr.
12082: Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
12083: was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As
12084: the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite
12085: imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her
12086: father's young wife.
12087: 
12088: "Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as
12089: in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.
12090: She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately
12091: devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey
12092: eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every
12093: little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her
12094: also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they
12095: seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow,
12096: this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the
12097: saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her
12098: in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of
12099: her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so
12100: utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small
12101: for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.
12102: His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between
12103: savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving
12104: pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea
12105: of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning
12106: the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would
12107: rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he
12108: has little to do with my story."
12109: 
12110: "I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they
12111: seem to you to be relevant or not."
12112: 
12113: "I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one
12114: unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was
12115: the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a
12116: man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,
12117: uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual
12118: smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been
12119: quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it.
12120: His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as
12121: silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most
12122: unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the
12123: nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one
12124: corner of the building.
12125: 
12126: "For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was
12127: very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after
12128: breakfast and whispered something to her husband.
12129: 
12130: "'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to
12131: you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut
12132: your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest
12133: iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue
12134: dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in
12135: your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should
12136: both be extremely obliged.'
12137: 
12138: "The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade
12139: of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it
12140: bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not
12141: have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr.
12142: and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which
12143: seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for
12144: me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching
12145: along the entire front of the house, with three long windows
12146: reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the
12147: central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was
12148: asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the
12149: other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest
12150: stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how
12151: comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs.
12152: Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so
12153: much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,
12154: anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle
12155: suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the
12156: day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in
12157: the nursery.
12158: 
12159: "Two days later this same performance was gone through under
12160: exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I
12161: sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny
12162: stories of which my employer had an immense rÃ©pertoire, and which
12163: he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and
12164: moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not
12165: fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for
12166: about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then
12167: suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and
12168: to change my dress.
12169: 
12170: "You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to
12171: what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly
12172: be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face
12173: away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire
12174: to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be
12175: impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been
12176: broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of
12177: the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst
12178: of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able
12179: with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I
12180: confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that
12181: was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I
12182: perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road,
12183: a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in
12184: my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are
12185: usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the
12186: railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I
12187: lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her
12188: eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing,
12189: but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my
12190: hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.
12191: 
12192: "'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the
12193: road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'
12194: 
12195: "'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.
12196: 
12197: "'No, I know no one in these parts.'
12198: 
12199: "'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to
12200: him to go away.'
12201: 
12202: "'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'
12203: 
12204: "'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn
12205: round and wave him away like that.'
12206: 
12207: "I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew
12208: down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have
12209: not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor
12210: seen the man in the road."
12211: 
12212: "Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a
12213: most interesting one."
12214: 
12215: "You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may
12216: prove to be little relation between the different incidents of
12217: which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper
12218: Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands
12219: near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp
12220: rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving
12221: about.
12222: 
12223: "'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two
12224: planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'
12225: 
12226: "I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a
12227: vague figure huddled up in the darkness.
12228: 
12229: "'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start
12230: which I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine,
12231: but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do
12232: anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,
12233: so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose
12234: every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs
12235: upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your
12236: foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life
12237: is worth.'
12238: 
12239: "The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to
12240: look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning.
12241: It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the
12242: house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was
12243: standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was
12244: aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper
12245: beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It
12246: was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging
12247: jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly
12248: across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.
12249: That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not
12250: think that any burglar could have done.
12251: 
12252: "And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as
12253: you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a
12254: great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the
12255: child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the
12256: furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.
12257: There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones
12258: empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two
12259: with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was
12260: naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It
12261: struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight,
12262: so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very
12263: first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There
12264: was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never
12265: guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.
12266: 
12267: "I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint,
12268: and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing
12269: obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in
12270: the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the
12271: contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two
12272: tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was
12273: it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at
12274: all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,
12275: and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that
12276: I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had
12277: locked.
12278: 
12279: "I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes,
12280: and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.
12281: There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited
12282: at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of
12283: the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked.
12284: One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle
12285: coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on
12286: his face which made him a very different person to the round,
12287: jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his
12288: brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his
12289: temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me
12290: without a word or a look.
12291: 
12292: "This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the
12293: grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I
12294: could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four
12295: of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the
12296: fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I
12297: strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle
12298: came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.
12299: 
12300: "'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you
12301: without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with
12302: business matters.'
12303: 
12304: "I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I,
12305: 'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one
12306: of them has the shutters up.'
12307: 
12308: "He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled
12309: at my remark.
12310: 
12311: "'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my
12312: dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we
12313: have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever
12314: believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest
12315: in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and
12316: annoyance, but no jest.
12317: 
12318: "Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there
12319: was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know,
12320: I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity,
12321: though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a
12322: feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this
12323: place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's
12324: instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,
12325: and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the
12326: forbidden door.
12327: 
12328: "It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,
12329: besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to
12330: do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large
12331: black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been
12332: drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when
12333: I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at
12334: all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both
12335: downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an
12336: admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock,
12337: opened the door, and slipped through.
12338: 
12339: "There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and
12340: uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.
12341: Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third
12342: of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and
12343: cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so
12344: thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through
12345: them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it
12346: had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked
12347: at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with
12348: stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was
12349: not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the
12350: shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from
12351: beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was
12352: a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the
12353: passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it
12354: might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room
12355: and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little
12356: slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad,
12357: unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My
12358: overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran
12359: as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the
12360: skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door,
12361: and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting
12362: outside.
12363: 
12364: "'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it
12365: must be when I saw the door open.'
12366: 
12367: "'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.
12368: 
12369: "'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how
12370: caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened
12371: you, my dear young lady?'
12372: 
12373: "But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I
12374: was keenly on my guard against him.
12375: 
12376: "'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered.
12377: 'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was
12378: frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in
12379: there!'
12380: 
12381: "'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.
12382: 
12383: "'Why, what did you think?' I asked.
12384: 
12385: "'Why do you think that I lock this door?'
12386: 
12387: "'I am sure that I do not know.'
12388: 
12389: "'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you
12390: see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.
12391: 
12392: "'I am sure if I had known--'
12393: 
12394: "'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over
12395: that threshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into
12396: a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a
12397: demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'
12398: 
12399: "I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that
12400: I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing
12401: until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I
12402: thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without
12403: some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the
12404: woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible
12405: to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of
12406: course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was
12407: almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would
12408: send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the
12409: office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then
12410: returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my
12411: mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I
12412: remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of
12413: insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one
12414: in the household who had any influence with the savage creature,
12415: or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and
12416: lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.
12417: I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this
12418: morning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and
12419: Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the
12420: evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you
12421: all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you
12422: could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should
12423: do."
12424: 
12425: Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.
12426: My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in
12427: his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon
12428: his face.
12429: 
12430: "Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.
12431: 
12432: "Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do
12433: nothing with him."
12434: 
12435: "That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"
12436: 
12437: "Yes."
12438: 
12439: "Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"
12440: 
12441: "Yes, the wine-cellar."
12442: 
12443: "You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very
12444: brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could
12445: perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not
12446: think you a quite exceptional woman."
12447: 
12448: "I will try. What is it?"
12449: 
12450: "We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend
12451: and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will,
12452: we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might
12453: give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some
12454: errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate
12455: matters immensely."
12456: 
12457: "I will do it."
12458: 
12459: "Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of
12460: course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been
12461: brought there to personate someone, and the real person is
12462: imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this
12463: prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice
12464: Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to
12465: America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height,
12466: figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very
12467: possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of
12468: course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you
12469: came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some
12470: friend of hers--possibly her fiancÃ©--and no doubt, as you wore
12471: the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your
12472: laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture,
12473: that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer
12474: desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent
12475: him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly
12476: clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of
12477: the child."
12478: 
12479: "What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.
12480: 
12481: "My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining
12482: light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the
12483: parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have
12484: frequently gained my first real insight into the character of
12485: parents by studying their children. This child's disposition is
12486: abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he
12487: derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or
12488: from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their
12489: power."
12490: 
12491: "I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A
12492: thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you
12493: have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to
12494: this poor creature."
12495: 
12496: "We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning
12497: man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall
12498: be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the
12499: mystery."
12500: 
12501: We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we
12502: reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside
12503: public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining
12504: like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were
12505: sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been
12506: standing smiling on the door-step.
12507: 
12508: "Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.
12509: 
12510: A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is
12511: Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring
12512: on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates
12513: of Mr. Rucastle's."
12514: 
12515: "You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now
12516: lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black
12517: business."
12518: 
12519: We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a
12520: passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss
12521: Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the
12522: transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but
12523: without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence
12524: Holmes' face clouded over.
12525: 
12526: "I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss
12527: Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put
12528: your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our
12529: way in."
12530: 
12531: It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united
12532: strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There
12533: was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a
12534: basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner
12535: gone.
12536: 
12537: "There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty
12538: has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim
12539: off."
12540: 
12541: "But how?"
12542: 
12543: "Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He
12544: swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the
12545: end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did
12546: it."
12547: 
12548: "But it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not
12549: there when the Rucastles went away."
12550: 
12551: "He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and
12552: dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were
12553: he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it
12554: would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."
12555: 
12556: The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at
12557: the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy
12558: stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the
12559: wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and
12560: confronted him.
12561: 
12562: "You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"
12563: 
12564: The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open
12565: skylight.
12566: 
12567: "It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies
12568: and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll
12569: serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he
12570: could go.
12571: 
12572: "He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.
12573: 
12574: "I have my revolver," said I.
12575: 
12576: "Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed
12577: down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we
12578: heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a
12579: horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An
12580: elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out
12581: at a side door.
12582: 
12583: "My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been
12584: fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"
12585: 
12586: Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with
12587: Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its
12588: black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and
12589: screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and
12590: it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great
12591: creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and
12592: carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid
12593: him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered
12594: Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to
12595: relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door
12596: opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.
12597: 
12598: "Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.
12599: 
12600: "Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he
12601: went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know
12602: what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains
12603: were wasted."
12604: 
12605: "Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs.
12606: Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else."
12607: 
12608: "Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."
12609: 
12610: "Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several
12611: points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."
12612: 
12613: "I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done
12614: so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's
12615: police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the
12616: one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend
12617: too.
12618: 
12619: "She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time
12620: that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no
12621: say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until
12622: after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could
12623: learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so
12624: quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them
12625: but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was
12626: safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming
12627: forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then
12628: her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to
12629: sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use
12630: her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until
12631: she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then
12632: she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her
12633: beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her
12634: young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."
12635: 
12636: "Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough
12637: to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce
12638: all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this
12639: system of imprisonment?"
12640: 
12641: "Yes, sir."
12642: 
12643: "And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of
12644: the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."
12645: 
12646: "That was it, sir."
12647: 
12648: "But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should
12649: be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain
12650: arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your
12651: interests were the same as his."
12652: 
12653: "Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said
12654: Mrs. Toller serenely.
12655: 
12656: "And in this way he managed that your good man should have no
12657: want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment
12658: when your master had gone out."
12659: 
12660: "You have it, sir, just as it happened."
12661: 
12662: "I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for
12663: you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And
12664: here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,
12665: Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,
12666: as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a
12667: questionable one."
12668: 
12669: And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the
12670: copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but
12671: was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of
12672: his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who
12673: probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it
12674: difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were
12675: married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their
12676: flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in
12677: the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend
12678: Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further
12679: interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
12680: of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
12681: Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.

13000: increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
13001: freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

13003: ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
13004: status with the IRS.
13005: 
13006: The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
13007: charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
13008: States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
13009: considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
13010: with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
13011: where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

13019: 
13020: International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
13021: any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

13026: ways including including checks, online payments and credit card

13033: Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
13034: concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared

13036: Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

13039: Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
13040: editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
13041: unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
13042: keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
